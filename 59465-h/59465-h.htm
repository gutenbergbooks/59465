<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE TO THE FIRST VOLUME.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The history of “the Ring,” its rise and progress, the deeds of the men whose
manly courage illustrate its contests in the days of its prosperity and
popularity, with the story of its decline and fall, as yet remain unwritten. The
author proposes in the pages which follow to supply this blank in the home-records
of the English people in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The
space covered in these volumes extends over one hundred and forty-four years,
from the time when James Fig (the first acknowledged champion) opened his
amphitheatre in the Oxford Road, in May, 1719, to the championship battle
between John Camel Heenan, the American, and Tom King, the English champion,
at Wadhurst, in Kent, on the 10th of December, 1863.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author trusts he may claim, without laying himself open to a charge of
egotism, exceptional qualifications for the task he has undertaken. His
acquaintance with the doings of the Ring, and his personal knowledge of the most
eminent professors of pugilism, extend over a retrospect of more than forty years.
For a considerable portion of that period he was the reporter of its various incidents
in <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>, in the <cite>Morning Advertiser</cite>, and various periodical
publications which, during the better days of its career, gave a portion of their
space to chronicle its doings. That the misconduct of its members, the degeneracy
and dishonesty of its followers led to the deserved extinction of the Ring, he is
free to admit: still, as a septuagenarian, he desires to preserve the memory of
many brave and honourable deeds which the reader will here find recorded.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few lines will suffice to elucidate the plan of the work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having decided that its most readable form would be that of a series of
biographies of the principal boxers, in chronological order, so far as practicable, it
was found convenient to group them in “Periods;” as each notable champion will
be seen to have visibly impressed his style and characteristics on the period in
which he and his imitators, antagonists or, as we may call it, “school” flourished
in popular favour and success.</p>

<p class='c007'>A glance at the “Lives of the Boxers” thus thrown into groups will explain this
arrangement:—</p>

Championship battle of King and Heenan, December, 1863.</p>

<p class='c007'>In “the Introduction” I have dealt with the “Classic” pugilism of Greece and
Rome. The darkness of the middle ages is as barren of record of “the art of self-defence”
as of other arts. With their revival in Italy we have an amusing
coincidence in the “Memoirs of Benvenuto Cellini,” in which a triumvirate of
renowned names are associated with the common-place event of “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">un grande
punzone<a id='tvi'></a> del naso</span>”—a mighty punch on the nose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Michael-Angelo (Buonarotti’s) nose was flat from a blow which he received in
his youth from Torrigiano,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a> a brother artist and countryman, who gave me the
following account of the occurrence: ‘I was,’ said Torrigiano, ‘extremely
irritated, and, doubling my fist, gave him such a violent blow on the nose that I
felt the cartilages yield as if they had been made of paste, and the mark I then
gave him he will carry to the grave.’” Cellini adds: “Torrigiano was a handsome
man, of consummate audacity, having rather the air of a bravo than a
sculptor: above all, his strange gestures,” [were they boxing attitudes?] “his
enormous voice, with a manner of knitting his brows, enough to frighten any
man who faced him, gave him a tremendous aspect, and he was continually
talking of his great feats among ‘those bears of Englishmen,’ whose country he
had lately quitted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Who knows—<i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">sempre il mal non vien par nocuere</span></i>—but we have to thank the now-neglected
art, whose precepts and practice inculcated the use of Nature’s weapon,
that the clenched hand of Torrigiano did not grasp a stiletto? What then
would have been the world’s loss? The majestic cupola of St. Peter’s, the
wondrous frescoes of the Sistine Chapel, “The Last Judgment,” the “Sleeping
Cupid” of Mautua, the “Bacchus” of Rome, and all the mighty works of the
greatest painter, sculptor, and architect of the 16th century, had probably been
uncreated had not Michael-Angelo’s fellow-student learned among “those bears of
Englishmen,” the art of administering a “mighty punch on the nose” in lieu of
the then ready stab of a lethal weapon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The testimony of St. Bernard to the merits of boxing as a substitute for the
deadly combats of his time, with an extract from Forsyth’s “Excursion in
Italy,” will be found at page xv. of the Introduction to this volume; and these may
bring us to the period when the first Stuart ascended the throne of “Merrie
Englande.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In Dr. Noble’s “History of the Cromwell Family,” we find the following
interesting notice of the fistic prowess of the statesman-warrior who, in after-times,
“made the sovereigns of Europe court the alliance and dread the might of England’s
arm.” At p. 94 vol. i., we read:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“They have a tradition at Huntingdon, that when King Charles I. (then Duke
of York), in his journey from Scotland to London, in the year 1604, rested in his
way at Hinchenbrooke, the seat of Sir Oliver Cromwell; the knight, to divert the
young prince, sent for his nephew Oliver, that he, with his own sons, might play
with his Royal Highness. It so chanced that the boys had not long been
together before Charles and Oliver disagreed, and came to blows. As the former
was a somewhat weakly boy, and the latter strong, it was no wonder the royal
visitor was worsted. Oliver, even at this age, so little regarded dignity that he
made the royal blood flow copiously from the Prince’s nose. This was looked upon
by many as a bad presage for the King when the civil war had commenced.”
The probability of this incident has been flippantly questioned. The writer has
lighted on the following in the dry pages of “Toone’s Chronology,” under James I.
“1603. April 27th. The King, arriving at Hinchenbrooke, was magnificently
entertained by Sir Oliver Cromwell, where also the Cambridge Doctors waited
upon his Majesty. May 3. The King arrived at Theobalds, in Hertfordshire, the
seat of Mr. Secretary Cecil’s. He made 200 Knights on his arrival in London and
on his journey thither from Edinburgh.” And in the next page we read: “1604.
Jan. 4. Prince Charles came into England (from Scotland) and was created
Duke of York. He had forty pounds per annum settled on him that he might
more honourably maintain that dignity.” It may be as well to observe that Charles I.
and Cromwell were of an age (both born in 1599), and each of them five years
old in 1604‒5; so that this juvenile encounter is highly probable, exemplifying
that “the child is father of the man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again in Malcolm’s “Manners and Customs of London,” vol. i., p. 425, we find
the subjoined extract from <cite>The Protestant Mercury</cite>, of January, 1681, which we
take to be the first prize-fight on newspaper record.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yesterday a match of boxing was performed before his Grace the Duke of
Albemarle, between the Duke’s footman and a butcher. The latter won the prize,
as he hath done many before, being accounted, though but a little man, the best
at that exercise in England.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here be proofs”: 1, of ducal patronage; 2, of a stake of money; 3, of
the custom of public boxing; 4, of the skill of the victor, “he being but a little
man;” and all in a five-line paragraph. The names of the Champions are
unwritten.</p>

<p class='c007'>This brings us to the period at which our first volume opens, in which will be
found the deeds and incidents of the Pugilists, the Prize-ring, and its patrons,
detailed from contemporary and authentic sources, down to the opening of the
present century. We cannot, however, close this somewhat gossiping preface
without an extract from a pleasant paper which has just fallen under our notice,
in which some of the notable men who admired and upheld the now-fallen fortunes
of boxing are vividly introduced by one whose reminiscences of bygone men and
manners are given in a sketch called “The Last of Limmer’s.” To the younger
reader it may be necessary to premise, that from the days when the Prince Regent,
Sheridan, and Beau Brummel imbibed their beeswing—when the nineteenth century
was in its infancy—down to the year of grace 1860, the name of “Limmer’s Hotel”
was “familiar in sporting men’s mouths as household words,” and co-extensive in
celebrity with “Tattersall’s” and “Weatherby’s.”</p>

lemon, and sugar, said to have been invented by John Collins, but recently
re-imported as a Yankee novelty. This per parenthesis, and we return to our
author.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In that little tunnelled recess at the bottom of the dark, low-browed coffee-oom,
the preliminaries of more prize-fights have been arranged by Sir St. Vincent
Cotton, Parson Ambrose, the late Lord Queensberry, Colonel Berkeley, his son, the
Marquis Drumlanrig, Sir Edward Kent, the famous Marquis of Waterford, Tom
Crommelin, the two Jack Myttons, the late Lord Longford, and the committee of the
Fair-play Club, than in the parlour of No. 5, Norfolk Street (the sanctum of
Vincent Dowling, Editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>), in Tom Spring’s parlour, or Jem Burn’s
‘snuggery.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let it not be imagined that any apology is needed, nor will be here vouchsafed
in defence of those to whom, whatever may have been their station in life, the
prize-ring was formerly dear. The once well-known and well-liked Tom
Crommelin, for instance, is the only survivor among those whom we chance to
have named, but in his far-distant Australian home he will have no cause to
remember with regret that he has often taken part in the promotion of pugilistic
encounters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“During the present century Great Britain has produced no more manly, no
honester, or more thoroughly English statesman than the uncle of the present
Earl Spencer, better known in political history under the name of Lord Althorp.
The late Sir Denis Le Marchant, in his delightful memoir of the nobleman who
led the House of Commons when the great Reform Bill was passed, tells us that
‘Lord Althorp made a real study of boxing, taking lessons from the best
instructors, whilst practising most assiduously, and, as he boasted, with great
success. He had many matches with his school-fellow, Lord Byron, and those
who witnessed his exploits with the gloves, and observed his cool, steady eye,
his broad chest and muscular limbs, and, above all, felt his hard blows, would
have been justified in saying that he was born to be a prize-fighter rather than a
Minister of State.’ Long after the retirement of Lord Althorp from office,
Mr. Evelyn Denison, who died as Lord Ossington, paid him a visit at Wiseton,
‘The <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em> of boxing were discussed,’ writes the late Speaker, ‘and Lord
Althorp became eloquent. He said that his conviction of the advantages of
pugilism was so strong that he had been seriously considering whether it was not a
duty that he owed to the public to go and attend every prize-fight which took
place, and thus to encourage the noble science to the extent of his power. He
gave us an account of prize-fights which he had attended—how he had seen
Mendoza knocked down for the first five or six rounds by Humphries, and seeming
almost beaten until the Jews got their money on, when, a hint being given, he
began in earnest and soon turned the tables. He described the fight between
Gully and the Chicken—how he rode down to Brickhill himself, and was loitering
about the inn door, when a barouche and four drove up with Lord Byron and a
party, and Jackson, the trainer—how they all dined together, and how pleasant
it had been. Next day came the fight, and he described the men stripping, the
intense excitement, the sparring, then the first round, and the attitudes of the
men—it was really worthy of Homer.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“A pursuit which was enthusiastically supported and believed in by William
Windham, Charles James Fox, Lord Althorp, and Lord Byron, stands in little
need of modern excuse on behalf of its promoters when Limmer’s was at its apogee.
Full many a well-known pugilist, with Michael-Angelo nose and square-cut jaw,
has stood, cap in hand, at the door of that historical coffee-room within which
Lord Queensberry—then Lord Drumlanrig—and Captain William Peel and the
late Lord Strathmore were taking their meals. In one window stands Colonel
Ouseley Higgins, Captain Little, and Major Hope Johnstone. A servant of the
major’s, with an unmistakable fighting face, enters with a note for his master. It
is from Lord Longford and Sir St. Vincent Cotton asking him to allow his valet to
be trained by Johnny Walker for a proximate prize fight. The servant, who is no
other than William Nelson, the breeder (before his death) of Plebeian, winner
of the Middle Park Plate, however, firmly declines the pugilistic honours his
aristocratic patrons design for him, so the fight is off. Hard by maybe seen the
stately Lord George Bentinck, in conference with his chief-commissioner, Harry
Hill,” &amp;c., &amp;c. We here break off the reminiscences of Limmer’s, as the rest of
this most readable paper deals solely with the celebrities of the turf.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last time the writer saw the late Sir Robert Peel, was at Willis’s Rooms, in
King Street, on the occasion of an Assault of Arms, given by the Officers of the
Household Brigade, whereat the art of self-defence was illustrated by the non-commissioned
officers of the Life Guards, Grenadier Guards, and Royal Artillery.
Corporal-Majors Limbert and Gray, Sergeants Dean and Venn, Corporal Toohig
(Royal Artillery), with Professors Gillemand, Shury, and Arnold, displayed their
skill with broadsword, foil, single-stick, and sabre against bayonet. The gloves,
too, were put on, and some sharp and manly bouts played by the stalwart
Guardsmen. The lamented Minister watched these with approving attention.
Then came a glove display in which Alec Keene put on the mittens with Arnold, the
“Professor of the Bond Street Gymnasium.” The sparring was admirable, and sir
Robert, who was in the midst of an aristocratic group, pressed forward to the
woollen boundary-rope. His eyes lighted up with the memories of Harrow school-days
and he clapped his hands in hearty applause of each well-delivered left or
right and each neat stop or parry. The bout was over, and neither was best man.
The writer perceived the deep interest of Sir Robert, and conveyed to the friendly
antagonists the desire of several gentlemen for “one round more.” It was complied
with, and closed with a pretty rally, in which a clean cross-counter and first and
sharpest home from Keene’s left proved the finale amid a round of applause. The
practised pugilist was too many for the professor of “mimic warfare.” Next
came another clever demonstration of the arts of attack and defence by
Johnny Walker and Ned Donnelly. Sir Robert was as hilarious as a schoolboy
cricketer when the winning run is got on the second innings. Turning
to Mr. C. C. Greville and the Hon. Robert Grimstone, he exclaimed, “There
is nothing that interests me like good boxing. It asks more steadiness, self-control,
aye, and manly courage than any other combat. You must take as
well as give—eye to eye, toe to toe, and arm to arm. Give my thanks to both the
men, they are brave and clever fellows, and I hope we shall never want such
among our countrymen.” It is gratifying to add that, to our knowledge, these
sentiments are the inheritance of the third Sir Robert, whose manly and patriotic
speech, at Exeter Hall, on the 17th of February, 1878, rings in our ears as we
write these lines.</p>

<p class='c007'>With such patrons of pugilism as those who faded away in “the last days of
Limmer’s,” departed the fair play, the spirit, and the very honesty, often tainted,
of the Ring. A few exceptional struggles—due rather to the uncompromising
honesty and courage of the men, or the absence of the blacklegs, low gamblers,
Hebrews, and flash publicans from the finding of the stakes, or making the market
odds—occurred from time to time; but these were mere flickerings of the expiring
flame. The Ring was doomed, not less by the misconduct of its professors than
by the discord and dishonest doings of its so-called patrons and their ruffianly
followers, unchecked by the saving salt of sporting gentlemen and men of honour,
courage, and standing in society. Down, deeper down, and ever downward it
went, till in its last days it became merely a ticket-selling swindle in the hands
of keepers of Haymarket night-houses, and slowly perished in infamy and indigence.
Yet, cannot the writer, looking back through a long vista of memorable
battles, and with the personal recollection of such men as Cribb (in his latter days),
Tom Spring, Jem Ward (still living), Painter, Neale, Jem Burn, John Martin,
Frank Redmond, Owen Swift, Alec Keene, with Tom Sayers, his opponent John
Heenan, and Tom King, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ultimus Romanorum</span></i> (now—1878—taking prizes as
a floriculturist at horticultural shows), believe that the art which was practised by
such men was without redeeming qualities. He would not seek to revive the
“glory of the Ring,” that is past, but he has thought it a worthy task to collect
and preserve its memories and its deeds of fortitude, skill, courage, and forbearance,
of which these pages will be found to contain memorable, spirit-stirring,
and honourable examples.</p>

<p class='c013'>The curious reader may find some interest in a few paragraphs on the Bibliography

Pierce Egan’s first volume of the “new series,” omitting those words. It was
written by Jon Bee, for Messrs. Sherwoods, who moved an injunction against

Hogg) an eloquent defence of pugilism, while he takes opportunity, through Sir
Morgan O’Doherty, to praise the manliness, fair play, and bravery of contemporary
professors of boxing. Several sonnets and other extracts from Blackwood

champions in a paraphrase, rather than a parody of Macaulay’s “Lays of Ancient

contains lines of power to make the blood of your Englishmen stir in days to
come, should the preachers of peace-at-any-price, pump water, parsimonious
pusillanimity, puritanic precision and propriety have left our youth any blood
to stir. See “Life of Sayers,” in vol. iii. Volumes cannot better express the contempt
which this keen observer of human nature and satirist of shams entertained
for the mawworms, who “compound for sins they are inclined to by damning
those they have no mind to,” than the subjoined brief extract:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fighting, of course, is wrong; but there are occasions when.... I mean
that one-handed fight of Sayers is one of the most spirit-stirring little stories;
and with every love and respect for Morality, my spirit says to her, ‘Do, for

gentle remarks for another day. Have the great kindness to stand a <em>leetle</em> aside,
and just let us see one or two more rounds between the men. That little man with

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.<br /> <br /> <span class='large'>BOXING AND BOXERS AMONG THE ANCIENTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The origin of boxing has been assumed by some superficial writers as
coeval with the earliest contests of man. This view appears to the writer
both crude and unphilosophical. It might be argued with equal probability
that the foil was antecedent to the sword, the sword to the dagger, or the
singlestick to the club with which the first murder was perpetrated. The
clumsiest and, so far as rude and blood-thirsty attack could contrive them,
the most deadly weapons were the first used; the sudden destruction of life,
not the art of defence, being the brutal instinct of the vengeful, cunning, and
cowardly savage, or the treacherous manslayer. This, too, would lead us
fairly to infer—as the most dangerous forms of the cæstus are the most
ancient, and the naked fist in combat appears nowhere to have been used in
the gladiatorial combats of Greece or Rome—that to England and her Anglo-Saxon
race is due this fairest and least dangerous of all forms of the duel;
and to attribute to a recent period the padded boxing-glove (at present the
air or pneumatic glove), by means of which the truly noble art of self-defence
can be safely and healthfully practised and illustrated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most polished people of antiquity included boxing among their sports.
With them it was also a <em>discipline</em>, an <em>exercise</em>, and an <em>art</em>. A discipline,
inasmuch as it was taught to pupils; an exercise, as followed in the public
games; and an art, on account of the previous trainings and studies it presupposed
in those who professed and practised it. Plutarch indeed asserts
that the “pugilate” was the most ancient of the three gymnic games performed
by the athletæ, who were divided into three classes—the <span class='sc'>Boxers</span>, the
<span class='sc'>Wrestlers</span>, and the <span class='sc'>Runners</span>. And thus Homer views the subject, and
generally follows this order in his descriptions of public celebrations. This,
too, is the natural sequence, in what philosopher Square would call “the
eternal fitness of things.” First, the man attacks (or defends himself) with
the fist; secondly, he closes or wrestles; and should fear, inferior skill, or
deficient strength tell him he had better avoid the conflict, he resorts to the
third course, and <em>runs</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A word on the derivation of our words, pugilism, pugilist, and boxing, all
of which have a common origin. <em>Pugilism</em> comes to us through the Latin
<em>pugilatus</em>, the art of fighting with the fist, as also does <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pugnus</span></i>, a fight. The
Latin again took these words from the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυγμὴ</span> (<em>pugmè</em>), the fist
doubled for fighting; whence also they had <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πύγμάχος</span> (<em>pugmachos</em>), a fist-fighter,
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πύγμαχια</span> (<em>pugmachia</em>), a fist-fight. They had also <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυγδον</span>
(<em>pugdon</em>), a measure of length from the elbow (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cubitus</span></i>) to the end of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>hand <em>with the fingers clenched</em>. Another form of the word, the Greek adverb
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυξ</span> (<em>pux</em>), <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pugno vel pugnis</span></i>, gives us <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυξος</span> (<em>puxos</em>, Lat. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">buxus</span></i>), in English,
<span class='fss'>BOX</span>; and it is remarkable that this form of the closed hand is the Greek
synonyme for anything in the shape of a closed <em>box</em> or receptacle, and so
it has passed to the moderns. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυξ</span>, <em>box</em> or <em>pyx</em>, is the chest in which
the sacramental vessels are contained. Thus mine Ancient Pistol pleads
for his red-nosed comrade:—</p>

      <div class='line'>But Exeter hath given the doom of death,</div>
      <div class='line'>For <span class='fss'>PYX</span> of little price.”</div>

<p class='c007'>The French have also imported <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le boxe</span></i> into their dictionaries, where the
Germans had it already, as <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">buchs</span></i>, a box. But enough of etymology; wherever
we got the word, the thing itself—fair boxing, as we practise it—is of
pure English origin. The Greeks, however, cultivated the science in their
fashion, confined it by strict rules, and selected experienced masters and professors,
who, by public lessons, delivered gratis in Palestræ and Gymnasiæ,
instructed youth in the theory and practice of the art. Kings and princes,
as we learn from the poets, laid aside their dignity for a few hours, and
exchanged the sceptre for the cæstus; indeed, in Greece, boxing, as a liberal
art, was cultivated with ardour, and when (once in three years) the whole
nation assembled at Corinth to celebrate their Isthmian games, in honour of
Neptune, the generous admiration of an applauding people placed the crown
on the brow of the successful pugilist, who, on his return home, was hailed
as the supporter of his country’s fame. Even Horace places the pugilist
<em>before</em> the poet:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Having alluded to the poets who have celebrated pugilism, we will take a
hasty glance at the demigods and heroes by whom boxing has been illustrated.
<span class='sc'>Pollux</span>, the twin brother of Castor—sprung from the intrigue of
Jupiter with the beauteous Leda, wife of Tyndarus, King of Sparta, and
mother of the fair Helen of Troy—presents us with a lofty pedigree as the
tutelary deity of the boxers. The twins fought their way to a seat on Mount
Olympus, as also did Hercules himself:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em>Hac arte</em> Pollux, et vagus Hercules</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Innixus arces attigit igneas;”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>the sign Gemini in our zodiac representing this pair of “pugs.” As one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>the unsuccessful competitors with Pollux, we may here mention <span class='sc'>Amycus</span>.
He was a son of Neptune, by Melia, and was king of the Bebryces. When
the Argonauts touched at his port, on their voyage to Colchis, he received
them with much hospitality. Amycus was renowned for his skill with the
cæstus, and he kept up a standing challenge to all strangers for a trial of
skill. Pollux accepted his challenge; but we learn from Apollonius that
Amycus did not fight fair, and tried by a trick to beat Pollux, whereupon
that “out-and-outer” killed him, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour encourager les autres</span></i>, we presume.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c009'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
There were two other pugilists of the same name among the “school” taken
by Æneas into Italy as we shall presently see.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Eryx</span>, also, figures among the heaven-descended pugilists. He was the
son of Venus, by Butes, a descendant of Amycus, and very skilful in the
use of the cæstus. He, too, kept up a standing challenge to all comers, and
so came to grief. For Hercules, who “barred neither weight, country, nor
colour,” coming that way, took up the gauntlet, and knocked poor Eryx clean
out of time; so they buried him on a hill where he had, like a pious son,
built a beautiful temple in honour of his rather too easy mamma. It is but
fair, however, in this instance, to state that there is another version of the
parentage of Eryx, not quite so lofty, but, to our poor thinking, quite as
creditable. It runs thus:—Butes, being on a Mediterranean voyage, touched
at the three-cornered island of Sicily (Trinacria), and there, sailor fashion,
was hooked by one Lycaste, a beautiful harlot, who was called by the
islanders “Venus.” She was the mother of Eryx, and so he was called the
son of Venus. (See Virgil, Æneid, b. v., l. 372.) However this may
be, the temple of Eryx and the “Erycinian Venus” were most renowned, and
Diodorus, the Sicilian, tells us that the Carthaginians revered Venus Erycina
as much as the Sicilians themselves, identifying her with the Phœnician
Astarte. So much for the genealogy of the fourth boxer.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Antæus</span> here claims a place. We have had a couple from heaven (by
Jupiter), and one from the sea (by Neptune), our next shall be from earth
and ocean combined. Antæus, though principally renowned as a wrestler, is
represented with the cæstus. He was the son of Terra, by Neptune; or, as the
stud-book would put it, by Neptune out of Terra. He was certainly dreadfully
given to “bounce,” for he threatened to erect a temple to his father
with the skulls of his conquered antagonists; but he planned his house before
he had procured the materials. The story runs, that whenever he kissed his
“mother earth” she renewed his strength, from which we may fairly infer
that he was an adept in the art of “getting down,” like many of our modern
pugilists. Hercules, however, found out the dodge by which the artful
Antæus got “second wind” and renewed strength. He accordingly put
on “the squeeze,” and giving him a cross-lift, held him off the ground till
he expired, which we take to have been foul play on the part of his Herculean
godship.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c009'><sup>[3]</sup></a> There was another Antæus, a friend of Turnus, killed by
Æneas in the Latin wars.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the Homeric boxers, <span class='sc'>Epeus</span> and <span class='sc'>Euryalus</span> are the most renowned.
Epeus was king of the Epei, a people of the Peloponnesus; he was son of
Endymion, and brother to Pæon and Æolus. As his papa was the paramour
of the goddess of chastity, Diana, the family may be said to have moved in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>high society. The story of Endymion and the goddess of the moon has been
a favourite with poets. Epeus was a “big one,” and, like others of Homer’s
heroes, a bit of a bully.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the twenty-third book of the Iliad we find the father of poetry places
the games at the funeral of Patroclus in this order:—1, The chariot race;
2, the cæstus fight; 3, the wrestling; 4, the foot race. As it is with the
second of these only that Epeus and Euryalus are concerned, we shall confine
ourselves to<a id='tviii'></a> the Homeric description.</p>

      <div class='line'>“The prizes next are ordered to the field,</div>

      <div class='line'>High o’er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,</div>

      <div class='line'>So let his friends be nigh, a needful train,</div>
      <div class='line'>To heave the battered carcase off the plain.’</div>
      <div class='line'>The giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze</div>
      <div class='line'>The host beheld him, silent with amaze!</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire</div>
      <div class='line'>To meet his might, and emulate thy sire,</div>
      <div class='line'>The great Megestheus, who, in days of yore,</div>
      <div class='line'>In Theban games the noblest trophy bore—</div>
      <div class='line'>(The games ordain’d dead Œdipus to grace),</div>
      <div class='line'>And singly vanquished the Cadmæan race.</div>
      <div class='line'>Him great Tydides urges to contend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend:</div>
      <div class='line'>Officious with the cincture girds him round;</div>

      <div class='line'>Amid the circle now each champion stands,</div>
      <div class='line'>And poises high in air his iron hands:</div>
      <div class='line'>With clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,</div>
      <div class='line'>And painful sweat from all their members flows.</div>
      <div class='line'>At length Epeus dealt a weighty blow</div>
      <div class='line'>Full on the cheek of his unwary foe;</div>
      <div class='line'>Beneath the ponderous arm’s resistless sway</div>
      <div class='line'>Down dropp’d he nerveless, and extended lay.</div>
      <div class='line'>As a large fish, when winds and waters roar,</div>
      <div class='line'>By some huge billow dash’d against the shore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lies panting: not less battered with the wound</div>
      <div class='line'>The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.</div>
      <div class='line'>To rear his fallen foe the victor lends,</div>
      <div class='line'>Scornful, his hand, and gives him to his friends.</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose arms support him reeling through the throng,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>And dragging his disabled legs along,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nodding, his head hangs down his shoulders o’er;</div>
      <div class='line'>His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore:</div>
      <div class='line'>Wrapped round in mists he lies, and lost to thought—</div>
      <div class='line'>His friends receive the bowl too dearly bought.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>So far the first report of a prize fight, which came off 1184 years <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, in
the last year of the siege of Troy, anno mundi, 3530.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was another <span class='sc'>Epeus</span>, son of Panopæus, who was a skilful carpenter,
and made the Greek mare, commonly but erroneously called the Trojan
horse,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c009'><sup>[4]</sup></a> in the womb of which the Argive warriors were introduced to the
ruin of beleaguered Troy, as related in the second book of the “Æneid.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Euryalus</span> will be known by name to newspaper readers of the present day
as having given name to the steam frigate in which our sailor Prince Alfred
took his earliest voyages to sea: to the scholar he is known as a valiant
Greek prince, who went to the Trojan war with eighty ships, at least so says
Homer, “Iliad,” b. ii.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Next move to war the generous Argive train,</div>
      <div class='line'>From high Trœzenè and Maseta’s plain;</div>
      <div class='line'>And fair Ægina circled by the main,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom strong Tyrinthe’s lofty walls surround,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Epidaure with viny harvest crowned,</div>
      <div class='line'>And where fair Asinen and Hermion show</div>

      <div class='line'>In fourscore barks they plough their watery way.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We may here note that Tydides (the family name of Diomed, as the son of
Tydeus) was Euryalus’s second in the mill with Epeus, wherein we have just
seen him so soundly thrashed by the big and bounceable Epeus. As Virgil
generally invents a “continuation” or counterpart of the Homeric heroes for
his “Æneid,” we find Euryalus made the hero of an episode, and celebrated
for his immortal friendship with Nisus: with him he had a partnership in
fighting, and they died together in a night encounter with the troops of the
Rutulians, whose camp they had plundered, but were overtaken and slain.
(Virg. Æneid, ix., 176.) We will now therefore shift the scene from Greece,
and come to Sicily and Italy, and the early boxing matches there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Æneas’ companions were a “school” of boxers, and met with the like in
Italy, among whom <span class='sc'>Entellus</span>, <span class='sc'>Eryx</span>, and <span class='sc'>Antæus</span> (already mentioned),
<span class='sc'>Dares</span>, <span class='sc'>Cloanthus</span>, <span class='sc'>Gyges</span>, <span class='sc'>Gyas</span>, etc., may be numbered.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Entellus</span>, the intimate of Eryx, and who conquered Dares at the funeral
games of Anchises (father of Æneas) in Sicily, deserves first mention. He
was even then an “old ’un,” but, unlike most who have “trusted a battle
to a waning age,” comes off gloriously in the encounter; which, as we shall
presently see, under Dares, gives an occasion for the second ring report of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>antiquity, as well as a minute description of the cæstus itself. The lines
from the fifth book of the “Æneid” need no preface. After the rowing
match (with galleys), in which Cloanthus (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>) is the victor, Æneas
thus addresses his assembled companions:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘If there be here whose dauntless courage dare</div>
      <div class='line'>In gauntlet-fight, with back and body bare,</div>
      <div class='line'>His opposite sustain in open view,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stand forth thou, champion, and the games renew:</div>
      <div class='line'>Two prizes I propose, and thus divide—</div>

      <div class='line'>Stalking he strides, his head erected bears;</div>
      <div class='line'>His nervous arms the weighty gauntlets wield</div>
      <div class='line'>And loud applauses echo through the field.</div>
      <div class='line'>Dares alone in combat sued to stand,</div>

      <div class='line'>The same at Hector’s funerals undertook</div>
      <div class='line'>Gigantic Butes of the Amycian stock,</div>

      <div class='line'>His brawny bulk and ample breast he shows,</div>
      <div class='line'>His lifted arms around his head he throws,</div>
      <div class='line'>And deals, in whistling air, his empty blows.</div>
      <div class='line'>His match is sought; but through the trembling band</div>
      <div class='line'>Not one dares answer to his proud demand.</div>
      <div class='line'>Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Already he devours the promised prize.</div>
      <div class='line'>He claims the bull with lawless insolence,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, having seized his horns, addressed the prince:</div>
      <div class='line'>‘If none my matchless valour dares oppose,</div>
      <div class='line'>How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?</div>
      <div class='line'>Permit me, chief, permit without delay,</div>

      <div class='line'>The crowd assents, and, with redoubled cries,</div>
      <div class='line'>For the proud challenger demands the prize.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Acestes then reproaches Entellus for allowing the prize to be carried off
uncontested. Entellus pleads “staleness” and “want of condition,” but
accepts the challenge.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Acestes fired with just disdain to see</div>
      <div class='line'>A plain usurped without a victory,</div>
      <div class='line'>Reproached Entellus thus, who sate beside,</div>
      <div class='line'>And heard and saw, unmoved, the Trojan’s pride.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Once, but in vain, a champion of renown,</div>
      <div class='line'>So tamely can you bear the ravished crown,</div>
      <div class='line'>The prize in triumph borne before your sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And shun for fear the danger of the fight.</div>
      <div class='line'>Where is your Eryx now, the boasted name,</div>
      <div class='line'>The god who taught your thundering arm the game?</div>
      <div class='line'>Where now your baffled honour? where the spoil</div>
      <div class='line'>That filled your house, and fame that filled our isle?’</div>
      <div class='line'>Entellus thus: ‘My soul is still the same,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unmoved with fears, and moved with martial fame;</div>
      <div class='line'>But my chill blood is curdled in my veins,</div>
      <div class='line'>And scarce the shadow of a man remains.</div>

      <div class='line'>The brave, who this decrepit age defies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Should feel my force without the promised prize.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>Entellus then throws down the gauntlets of Eryx (engraved under Cæstus,
pp. xiii., xiv.), but Dares, declining the ponderous weapons, old Entellus
offers to accommodate him, by permission of the umpires, with a round or
two with a lighter pair.</p>

      <div class='line'>“‘But if the challenger these arms refuse,</div>

      <div class='line'>This said, Entellus for the fight prepares,</div>

      <div class='line'>Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around</div>
      <div class='line'>Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound;</div>
      <div class='line'>A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies,</div>
      <div class='line'>And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes—</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor always errs, for oft the gauntlet draws</div>
      <div class='line'>A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hoary with age Entellus stands his ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>But with his warping body wards the wound.</div>
      <div class='line'>His hand and watchful eye keep even pace,</div>
      <div class='line'>While Dares traverses and shifts his place,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, like a captain who beleaguers round</div>
      <div class='line'>Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>Views all the approaches with observing eyes;</div>
      <div class='line'>This and that other part in vain he tries,</div>
      <div class='line'>And more on industry than force relies.</div>
      <div class='line'>With hands on high Entellus threats the foe;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Dares watched the motion from below,</div>
      <div class='line'>And slipped a-side, and shunned the long-descending blow.</div>
      <div class='line'>Entellus wastes his forces on the wind,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, thus deluded of the stroke designed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Headlong and heavy fell, his ample breast</div>
      <div class='line'>And weighty limbs his ancient mother pressed.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So falls a hollow pine that long had stood</div>
      <div class='line'>On Ida’s height or Erymanthus’ wood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Torn from the roots. The differing nations rise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And shouts, with mingled murmurs, rend the skies.</div>
      <div class='line'>Acestes runs with eager haste to raise</div>
      <div class='line'>The fallen companion of his youthful days.</div>
      <div class='line'>Dauntless he rose, and to the fight returned;</div>
      <div class='line'>With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burned</div>
      <div class='line'>Disdain and conscious virtue filled his breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with redoubled force his foe he pressed.</div>
      <div class='line'>He lays on load with either hand amain</div>
      <div class='line'>And headlong drives the Trojan o’er the plain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor stops nor stays nor rests nor breath allows</div>
      <div class='line'>But storms of strokes descend about his brows,</div>
      <div class='line'>A rattling tempest and a hail of blows.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At this point of the combat—when, after what ought to have closed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>round 1, by the fall of old Entellus, the latter jumps up and renews the
fight, driving Dares in confusion before him—we find that the referee and
stakeholder had a judicial discretionary power to stop the fight, the more
necessary on account of the deadly gloves in use. Some such power, in cases
of closing and attempts at garotting (such as occurred at Farnham and at
Wadhurst in 1860 and 1863, and numerous minor battles), should be vested
in the referee; but then where is the man who in modern times would be
efficiently supported or obeyed in this judicial exercise of authority?</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But now the prince, who saw the wild increase</div>

      <div class='line'>First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,</div>

      <div class='line'>His mouth and nostrils poured a purple flood,</div>
      <div class='line'>And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.</div>
      <div class='line'>Faintly he staggered through the hissing throng,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hung his head and trailed his legs along.</div>
      <div class='line'>The sword and casque are carried by his train,</div>
      <div class='line'>But with his foe the palm and ox remain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The reader will doubtless be forcibly struck with the close imitation of
Homer by the later epic poet. The length of this account—given, as are
those in the ensuing pages, under the name of the winner—will render
superfluous a lengthy notice of the vanquished—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dares</span>, another of the companions of Æneas, who also, like St. Patrick,
was “a jontleman, and came of dacent people.” Indeed, we see that he
claimed to be descended from King Amycus. Your ancient pugilists seem to
have been as anxious about “blood” as a modern horse-breeder. Dares was
afterwards slain by Turnus in Italy. See Virg. Æneid, v. 369, xii. 363.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cloanthus</span>, too, fought some good battles; and from him the noble
Roman family of the Cluentii boasted their descent. In “Æneid,” v. 122,
he wins the rowing match.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of <span class='sc'>Gyges’</span> match we merely learn that Turnus also slew him; and of <span class='sc'>Gyas</span>,
that he greatly distinguished himself by his prowess in the funeral games of
Anchises in Sicily. As to the “pious” <span class='sc'>Æneas</span> himself, another son of Venus,
by Anchises, he was a fighting man all his days. First, in the Trojan war,
where he engaged in combat with Diomed and with Achilles himself, and
afterwards, on his various voyagings in Sicily, Africa, and Italy, where he
fought for a wife and a kingdom, and won both by killing his rival Turnus,
marrying Lavinia, and succeeding his father-in-law, Latinus. Despite his
“piety” in carrying off his old father Anchises from the flames of Troy, and
giving him such a grand funeral, Æneas seems to have been a filibustering
sort of vagrant; and after getting rid of poor Turnus, not without suspicions
of foul play, he was drowned in crossing a river in Etruria, which territory
he had invaded on a marauding expedition. We cannot say much
against him on the score of “cruelty and desertion” in the matter of Queen
Dido, seeing that chronology proves that the Carthaginian Queen was not
born until about three hundred years after the fall of Troy, and therefore the
whole story is the pure fabrication of the Roman poets, Virgil and Ovid.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>This, however, is by the way, so we will proceed to give a short account of
the implements used in ancient boxing.</p>

<p class='c007'>These were the <span class='sc'>Cæstus</span>, a formidable gauntlet composed of thongs of raw
hide, with the woollen glove covering the hand with its vellus or fringe; and
the <span class='sc'>Amphotides</span>, a kind of helmet or defensive armour for the head. Four
principal forms of the cæstus are known by extant representations. The first is
the most tremendous, and was found in bronze at Herculaneum. The original
hand is somewhat above the natural size, and appears to have been part of
the statue of some armed gladiator. It is formed of several thicknesses of
raw hide strongly fastened together, and cut into a circular form. These
have holes to admit the four fingers, the thumb being closed on the outer
edge to secure the hold, while the whole is bound by thongs round the wrist
and forearm, with its inner side on the palm of the hand and its outer edge
projecting in front of the knuckles. Our Yankee friends have a small imitation
in their modern “knuckle-dusters.” A glove of thick worsted was worn
beneath the gauntlet, ending in a fringe or bunch of wool, called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vellus</span></i>.
Lactantius says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pentedactylos laneos sub cæstibus habent</span>.” The figure
given in the Abbé St. Non’s, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyage Pittoresque de Naples et de Sicile</span>,”
is here copied.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 1.—Cæstus.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The second form of cæstus, though less deadly at first aspect, is capable of
administering the most fatal blows. This sort is represented in a bronze
group, engraved in the first volume of the “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bronzi del<a id='txiii'></a> Museo Kircheriano</span>,”
which represents the battle between Amycus and Pollux, already noticed.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 2.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This (or the fourth form of glove) would also seem to have been that
offered by Entellus to Dares in the fifth book of the Æneid, though the
“knobs of brass,” “blunt points of iron,” “plummets of lead,” and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>superfluities of barbarity, are not visible. Virgil’s description of the cæstus
being the best, we here quote it:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>“He (Entellus) threw</div>
      <div class='line'>Two pond’rous gauntlets down, in open view;</div>
      <div class='line'>Gauntlets, which Eryx wont in fight to wield,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sheathe his hands within the listed field.</div>
      <div class='line'>With fear and wonder seiz’d the crowd beholds</div>
      <div class='line'>The gloves of death,—with sev’n distinguish’d folds</div>
      <div class='line'>Of tough bull’s hides; the space within is spread</div>
      <div class='line'>With iron or with loads of heavy lead.</div>
      <div class='line'>Dares himself was daunted at the sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Renounc’d his challenge, and refused to fight.</div>
      <div class='line'>Astonish’d at their weight, the hero stands,</div>
      <div class='line'>And pois’d the pond’rous engines in his hands.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In Smith’s “Antiquities of Greece and Rome,” and in Lenu’s “Costumes
des Peuples de l’Antiquité,” are other patterns. The subjoined is from the
last named work.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 3.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The last form (No. 4) we shall give is also from a bas-relief found at
Herculaneum. It is certainly of a less destructive form, the knuckles and
back of the hand being covered by the leather, held in its place by a thumbhole,
and further secured by two crossed straps to the vellus, which ends
half way up the forearm. A similar engraving forms the tail-piece to
the fifty-first page of the second volume of the Abbé St. Non’s “Voyage
Pittoresque,” already quoted.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 4.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The <span class='sc'>Amphotides</span>, a helmet or head-guard, to secure the temporal bones
and arteries, encompassed the ears with thongs and ligatures, which were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>buckled either under the chin or behind the head. They bore some resemblance
to the head guards used in modern broadsword and stick play, but
seem to have fitted close. They were made of hides of bulls, studded with
knobs of iron, and thickly quilted inside to dull the concussion of the blows.
Though it may be doubted whether the amphotides were introduced until a
later period of the pugilistic era, yet as their representation would prevent
the faces or heads of the combatants being seen, sculptors and fresco painters
would leave them out unhesitatingly, as they do head-dresses, belts, reins,
horses’ harness, etc., regardless of reality, and seeking only what they
deemed high art in their representations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The search after traces of boxing among the barbarism of the Middle Ages,
with their iron cruelty and deadly warfare—not unredeemed, however, by
rude codes of honour, knightly courtesy, and chivalrous gallantry, in defence
of the weak and in honour of the fair—would not be worth the while. The
higher orders jousted and tilted with lance, mace, and sword, the lower
fought with sand-bags and the quarter-staff.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wrestling, as an art, seems to have only survived among Gothic or Scandinavian
peoples. A “punch on the head,” advocated by Mr. Grantley
Berkeley as a poacher’s punishment, is, however, spoken of by Ariosto as
the result of his romantic hero’s wrath, who gives the offender “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">un gran
punzone sulla testa</span>,” by way of caution. That there were “men before
their time,” who saw the best remedy for the fatal abuse of deadly weapons
in popular brawls, we have the testimony of no less an authority than St.
Bernard. That holy and peace-loving father of the Church, as we are told
by Forsyth, and numerous other writers, established boxing as a safety-valve
for the pugnacious propensities of the people. He tells us: “The
strongest bond of union among the Italians is only a coincidence of hatred.
Never were the Tuscans so unanimous as in hating the other States of Italy.
The Senesi agreed best in hating all the other Tuscans; the citizens of
Siena in hating the rest of the Senesi; and in the city itself the same
amiable passion was subdivided among the different wards.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This last ramification of hatred had formerly exposed the town to very
fatal conflicts, till at length, in the year 1200, St. Bernardine instituted
<span class='sc'>Boxing</span> as a more innocent vent to their hot blood, and laid the bruisers
under certain laws, which are sacredly observed to this day. As they
improved in prowess and skill, the pugilists came forward on every point of
national honour: they were sung by poets and recorded in inscriptions.
The elegant Savini ranks boxing among the holiday pleasures of Siena.”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c009'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>These desultory jottings must suffice to bring the history of boxing among
the ancients down to the period of its gradual extinction as an art and its
public and authorised practice. A few sentences from the pen of the late
V. G. Dowling, Esq.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c009'><sup>[6]</sup></a> will appropriately close this introductory chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Both among the Greeks and Romans the practice of pugilism, although
differing in its main features from our modern and less dangerous combats,
was considered essential in the education of their youth, from its manifest
utility in ‘strengthening the body, dissipating all fear, and infusing a manly
courage into the system.’ The power of punishment, rather than the ‘art of
self-defence,’ however, seems to have been the main object of the ancients;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>and he who dealt the heaviest blow, without regard to protecting his own
person, stood foremost in the list of heroes. Not so in modern times; for
while the quantum of punishment in the end must decide the question of
victory or defeat, yet the true British boxer gains most applause by the
degree of science which he displays in defending his own person, while with
quickness and precision he returns the intended compliments of his antagonist,
and like a skilful chess-player, takes advantage of every opening which
chance presents, thereby illustrating the value of coolness and self-possession
at the moment when danger is most imminent. The annals of our country
from the invasion of the Romans downwards sufficiently demonstrates that
the native Briton trusted more to the strength of his arm, the muscular
vigour of his frame, and the fearless attributes of his mind in the hour of
danger, than to any artificial expedients; and that, whether in attack or
defence, the combination of those qualities rendered him at all times formidable
in the eyes of his assailants, however skilled in the science or practice
of warfare. If illustrations were required to establish this proposition, they
are to be found in every page of our history, from the days of Alfred to the
battle of Waterloo; and if it be asked how it is that Englishmen stand thus
pre-eminent in the eyes of the world, it may be answered that it is to be
ascribed to the encouragement given to those manly games (boxing more
especially) which are characteristic of their country, and which, while they
invigorate the system, sustain and induce that moral courage which experience
has shown us to be the result as much of education as of constitution,
perhaps more of the former than of the latter. The truth of this conclusion
was so strongly impressed on the feelings of our forefathers, even in the most
barbarous ages, that we find all their pastimes were tinctured with a desire
to acquire superiority in their athletic recreations, thus in peace inculcating
those principles which in war became their safest reliance.” <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Esto perpetua!</span></i></p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Prefatory Remarks.—Fig—Sutton—Whitaker—Peartree—Pipes—Gretting.</span></h4>

<p class='c013'>We have collected in our Introductory Chapter the few scattered notices
of pugilism as practised and understood by the earlier Celtic nations.
Despite, however, the proclivity of antiquaries, historians, and scholars to
find a Roman or Greek origin for every manner, custom, and tradition—as
if we had none originally of our own,—we may safely say that Boxing, in
the noble manly forbearing and humane practice of the art, is the indigenous
offspring of British hardihood, steady courage, and love of gymnic
exercise and feats of bodily strength and skill, not unaccompanied with that
amount of risk and severe exertion which lend a zest to sports unappreciated
and unknown to more effeminate, more cruel, and more cowardly peoples.
Let not this be taken as the hasty expression of insular prejudice. The
writer, after deeply considering, and often witnessing, the personal contests
of men in his own country and abroad, and dispassionately weighing
the manner, accessories, and consequences of such contests, feels it a duty
he owes to a half-informed and prejudiced society to express the result
of his experience and his reflection, without fear, favour, or affection:—fear
of the onslaughts of spiritual and moral quacks; favour for those
who have degraded or debased a useful and laudable national exercise and
sport; or affection, more than is due to an art which he would fain rescue
from the obloquy and condemnation to which blind hostility and canting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>prejudice have consigned it. He would fain uphold that pugilistic combat
which a fair field, no favour, and surrender at all times at the will of either
party, distinguishes from every mode of conflict yet devised or practised for
the settlement of those “offences” which the highest authority has told us
“needs must come.” At a period within the earlier memories of the writer,
a school of babblers flooded the press with theories of the perfectibility of
man, the ultimate establishment of universal freedom, and the sublimation
of the human faculties by general education and popular science; and a
period was confidently predicted by these theorising shallowpates, when
war would be an “impossibility” as against the “interests” of men
and nations. We have lived to see the most sanguinary and ferocious contest
in history among the people whom these sciolists set up as the bright
example to the “less educated” nations of the Old World. We may, therefore,
safely despise the “new light” philosophy, and revert to the eternal
truth already cited—“needs must be that offences will come;” and this
necessity being inevitable, the next logical step is to consider how these
“offences” may be best dealt with and atoned.</p>

<p class='c007'>So long as man is liable to the imperfections of his nature he will need
the art of defending himself from attack and injury, and of redressing wrong
or insult that may be offered him. All experience has taught us that the
passions of pride and emulation (honourable like every human attribute
within limits), and resentment for injury, are the springs of some of our
noblest actions. It is to the stifling and too severe repression of the active
energies of a resolute and independent spirit that the soul of man as an
individual, and of a nation as a whole, sinks into the vengeful cowardice and
cruel pusillanimity of the abject yet ferocious slave. As, then, a greater or
less portion of evil must be attached to the best system of popular moral or
civil restraint, the wisest policy is that which legislates for man <em>as we find
him</em>, and not as the perfect or perfectible (?) creature which theorists and
bigots pretend that <em>he ought to be</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the risk of repetition we will return to our argument. Individuals, as
well as states, must have their disputes, their quarrels, and then—their
battles. This is, there is no denying, the sad but natural—the regrettable
but inevitable, condition and tenure on which human life—nay, all animal
existence—is held. There must, then, be some mode through which the
passions, when aroused, from whatever cause,—</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>may be assuaged, subdued, or extinguished; when the necessity for an appeal
to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultima ratio</span></i> of conflict is unavoidable. And surely, in this extremity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the <em>fists</em>—the symbol of personal courage, of prompt readiness for defence
and attack—are the most harmless, the ever-present, and the least fatal
weapons. We will leave, gentle or simple reader, the pistol to your
higher-born countrymen of the “upper ten thousand,” if it so please them;
the fatal <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleuret</span></i> to the fire-eating Gaul (whether soldier, <em>litterateur</em>, or
“pekin”); the back-handed stiletto to the stabbing Italian; the sharp,
triangular rapier or the dagger to the saturnine Spaniard; the slaughterous
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schlager</span></i> to the beer-bemused burschen<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c009'><sup>[7]</sup></a> of dreamy Vaterland; the gash-inflicting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>knife to the Dutch boor or seaman’s snicker-snee; the death-dealing
“bowie,” “Kansas toothpick,” and murderous “six-shooter” to
the catawampous citizen of the “univarsal Yankee nation;” the waved
kreese, to the muck-running Malay; each tawny savage to his sharp tomahawk,
his poisoned arrow, or his barbed assagai; and then we would ask the
scribblers of the anti-pugilistic press which of these they are prepared to
champion against the fist of the British boxer,—a weapon of defence which,
as exemplified in the practice laid down in the latest code of Ring Law, is
the perfection of the practice of cool courage, self-reticent combat, restraint,
skill, and endurance that can illustrate and adorn the character of an unsophisticated
and true-hearted Englishman in the supreme moment of conquest
or of defeat.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has frequently been urged by magistrates, and even ermined judges<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c009'><sup>[8]</sup></a> of
quasi-liberal sentiments, that pugilism, as a national practice, and an occasional
or fortuitous occurrence, may be winked at by the authorities, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>tacitly allowed, and prohibited or punished at discretion, as the occasion may
seem to require: but that gymnastic schools where boxing is regularly
taught, and pitched battles, are social nuisances which the law should rigorously
suppress. Granting the possibility of this utter repression, which we
deny, it may well be questioned whether we have not tried to suppress a
lesser evil to evolve a greater.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c009'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To boxing-schools and regulated combats we owe that noble system of
fistic ethics, of fair play, which distinguishes and elevates our common
people, and which stern, impartial, unprejudiced and logical minds must
hail and foster as one of the proud attributes of our national character. We
do not in the least undervalue peaceful pursuits, which constitute and uphold
the blessings of peaceful life; yet a nation with no idea or principle beyond
commerce would be unworthy, nay, would be impotent for national existence,
much more for national power and progress. Subjection, conquest, and
hence serfdom and poverty, must be its fate in presence of strong, rapacious,
and encroaching neighbours. “The people that possesses steel,” said the
ancient assailant of the Lydian Crœsus, “needs not long want for gold.” A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>portion, then, of a nation must be set apart, whose vocation it will be to secure
and to defend the lives, liberties, and properties of the whole. Hence the
honourable calling of the soldier and the sailor; and hence, to fit the people
for these, and to prevent the too general indulgence of effeminacy, dread of
enterprise, and the contagious spread of an enervating and fanatical peace-at-any-price
quietism, it is wise and politic to encourage the manly and athletic
sports and contests which invigorate the frame, brace the nerves, inspire
contempt of personal suffering, and enable man to defend his rights as well
as to enjoy them. Englishmen have learned, and we sincerely hope will
continue to learn and to practise, fair boxing, as they have learned other
arts of defence,—the use of the rifle among others, in which (as their sires of
old did with the yeoman’s bow) they have already excelled Swiss, American,
and Australian mountaineers and woodmen: men from countries celebrated
for their practice of long shots, and constant handling of the weapon. Let them,
therefore, see that the fair use of the fist is not sneered down by the craven
or the canter. Were every pugilistic school shut up, the practice of boxing
discouraged, and the fiat of our modern intolerant saints carried out, the
manly spirit of fair play in our combats would disappear, and the people of
this country lose one of their fairest characteristics. A retrospect of the last
ten years will answer whether these are times to incur such risk; while at
home, how-much-soever we may have had of the fist, we have indeed had too
much of the loaded bludgeon, the mis-named “life-preserver,” the garotte,
the knife, and the revolver.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pugilistic exhibitions are falsely said to harden the heart, to induce ferocity
of character, and that they are generally attended by the dregs of society.
The last aspersion, for reasons that lie on the surface, has the most truth in
it. The principle only, indeed the utility and necessity of the practice of
boxing, is all we here propose to vindicate. Pugilism includes nothing essentially
vicious; nothing, in itself, prompting to excess or debauchery. On the
contrary, it asks temperance, exercise, and self-denial. If we are to argue and
decide from the abuse of a custom or institution, where are we to stop? Men
are not to be cured, even of errors, by the mere arbitrary force of laws, or by
a cherished pursuit being vilified and contemned, mostly by those who are
ignorant or averse to it. Teach men to respect themselves—this is the first
step to make them respect others. Let this rule be applied to the Ring; let
it be viewed as a popular institution; it may then, and we have warrant
from experience, and in the history contained in these pages, become worthy
of support and patronage. A series of biographies, which include the names
of Cribb, Jackson, Gully, Shaw, Spring, Sayers, etc. (within the memory of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>men yet living) may be pointed to without a blush; while individual traits of
heroism, generosity, forbearance, and humanity, will be found scattered as
bright redeeming points through the lives of many of the “rough diamonds”
preserved in the “setting” of our pages. We doubt not, were the character
of the Ring raised, that successors of as good repute as these worthies would
yet be found and arise among the brotherhood of the fist. Should this “consummation
devoutly to be wished” ever be realised, our gymnasia, a public
necessity, might then be licensed,—a security for their visitors, and adding
respectability to their proprietors; for every government possesses the power
of making expedient regulations, in the interest of society, even where it
may not have the right to absolutely suppress or interdict. If free trade,
and unrestricted leave to carry on profession or calling are such fundamental
principles with our state economists, why not free boxing? and why not
leave the morale of pugilism, as well as the morality of its professors, to find
its level in the neglect or the patronage, the esteem or the contempt, of
the people at large? Boxing and boxing schools, as free Britons, we must
have. Let us, then, consider, how they can be best made to serve the cause
of regulated pugilism. On the whole, there is no reason to doubt the practicability,
as well as the desirability, of public boxing-schools as a branch of a
system of national gymnastics. It is absurd as well as scandalous to assert
that they must, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex necessitate</span></i>, be the resort of profligates and thieves. As to
the last named scourges of society, long observation and experience<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c009'><sup>[10]</sup></a> have convinced
us that we have our metropolitan and even rural nurseries for them;
our “sin and crime gardens” for their special propagation, rearing, and multiplication;
and we can conscientiously say, from an equally long observation,
that among those thieves’ nurseries and “sin-gardens” the much-vilified
Prize Ring has no special claim to be counted.</p>

<p class='c007'>These remarks have extended to an extreme length, and we will here break
off, premising that many opportunities will present themselves in the course
of our history to illustrate and enforce the arguments and principles here laid
down. Waiving, then, all question as to its origin, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ars pugilistica</span></i> may be
accepted as interwoven for many generations in the manners and habits of
the English people; that it has become one of our “popular prejudices,” if
you so please to term it; and that we will not abandon it to be suppressed
by force or sneered down by cant or sophistry. It has long since, in this
favoured country, been purged of its cruelty and barbarism, and restrained
within well-considered bounds. No lacerating or stunning additions, such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>as we see pictured in our sketches of the ancient athletes, have been allowed
to Nature’s weapon—the clenched fist. On the contrary, for the practice of
the neophyte and the demonstration of the art by the professor, soft wool-padded
gloves cover the knuckles and backs of the hands of the sparrers.
Finally, foul blows, butting with the head, and deliberate falls, have been particularised
and forbidden, and an unimpeachable system of fair play established,
to be found in the “New Rules of the Ring.” We have nationally imbibed
these principles, and hence among our lower orders the feeling of “fair
play” is more remarkably prevalent than among any other people of Europe
or the New World. Hence personal safety—the exceptions, though occasionally
alarming, prove the rule<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c009'><sup>[11]</sup></a>—is more general in England than in any
other country. Here alone the fallen combatant is protected; and here the
detestable practices of gouging, biting, kicking in vital parts, practised by
Americans, Hiberno-Americans, and other foreigners, are heartily denounced
and scouted; and to what do we owe these characteristics? We repeat it,
to the <span class='sc'>Principles and Practice of Pugilism</span>.</p>

sported their Adam’s livery on the greensward, and stood up toe to toe for
“love and a bellyful,” yet the name of James Fig, a native of Thame, in
Oxfordshire, is, thanks to the pen of Captain Godfrey and the pencil of the

<p>FIG’S CARD.<br /><br />DISTRIBUTED TO HIS PATRONS, AND AT HIS BOOTHS AT SOUTHWARK FAIR AND ELSEWHERE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>To Captain Godfrey’s spirited and scarce quarto, entitled “A Treatise on
the Useful Science of Defence,” we are indebted for the preservation of the
names and descriptions of the persons and styles of the athletes who were his
contemporaries. It would seem that though Fig has been acknowledged as
the Father of the Ring, he was as much, if not more, distinguished as a
cudgel and back-sword player then as a pugilist. Captain Godfrey thus
speaks of Fig:—“I have purchased my knowledge with many a broken
head, and bruises in every part of me. I chose mostly to go to Fig<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c009'><sup>[12]</sup></a> and
exercise with him; partly, as I knew him to be the ablest master, and
partly, as he was of a rugged temper, and would spare no man, high or low,
who took up a stick against him. I bore his rough treatment with determined
patience, and followed him so long, that Fig, at last, finding he could
not have the beating of me at so cheap a rate as usual, did not show such
fondness for my company. This is well known by gentlemen of distinguished
rank, who used to be pleased in setting us together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The reputation of Fig having induced him to open an academy (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1719),
known as “Fig’s Amphitheatre,” in Tottenham Court Road, the place became
shortly a great attraction, and was crowded with spectators. It was
here that Captain Godfrey (the Barclay of his time) displayed his skill and
elegance in manly sports with the most determined competitors, the sports
being witnessed by royal and noble personages, who supported the science
as tending to endue the people with hardihood and intrepidity. About 1720
Fig resided in Oxford Road, now Oxford-street, and at the period of the
curious fac-simile, here for the first time engraved, we find him still in the
same neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The science of pugilism, as we now understand it, was certainly in its
infancy; the system of “give and take” was adopted, and he who could hit
the hardest, or submit to punishment with the best grace, seems to have been
in highest favour with the amateurs. Yet Fig’s placards profess to teach
“defence scientifically,” and his fame for “stops and parries” was so great,
that we find him mentioned in the <cite>Tatler</cite>, <cite>Guardian</cite>, and <cite>Craftsman</cite>, the
foremost miscellanies of the time.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c009'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Fig, like modern managers, added to the
attractions of his amphitheatre by “stars;” among these were <span class='sc'>Ned Sutton</span>,
the Pipemaker of Gravesend, Timothy Buck, Thomas Stokes, and others,
of whom only the names remain. Bill Flanders, or Flinders, “a noted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>scholar of Fig’s,” fought at the amphitheatre, in 1723, with one Chris.
Clarkson, known as “the Old Soldier.” The battle is highly spoken of for
determined courage in the “diurnals” of the period.</p>

<p class='c007'>Smithfield, Moorfields, St. George’s Fields, Southwark, and Hyde Park,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c009'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
during this period also had “booths” and “rings” for the display of boxing
and stick play. In Hogarth’s celebrated picture of “Southwark Fair” our
hero prominently figures, in a caricatured exaggeration, challenging any of
the crowd to enter the lists with him for “money, love, or a bellyful.”
This picture we have also chosen as an interesting illustration of the great
English painter,—a record of manners in a rude period. As one of the bills
relating to this fair (which was suppressed in 1763) is extant, we subjoin it:</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides this nobly patronised amphitheatre of Fig, there were several booths
and rings strongly supported. That in Smithfield, we have it upon good
authority, was presided over by one “Mr. Andrew Johnson,” asserted to
be an uncle of the great lexicographer,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c009'><sup>[15]</sup></a> There was also that in Moorfields,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>called at times “the booth,” at others “the ring.” The “ring” was kept
by an eccentric character known as “Old Vinegar,” the “booth” by Rimmington,
whose <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</span></i> was “Long Charles.” This, it appears, had a
curious emblazonment,—a skull and cross-bones on a black ground, inscribed
“Death or Victory.” During the high tide of Fig’s prosperity (1733) occurred
the battle between Bob Whitaker and the Venetian Gondolier, narrated
under the head of “<span class='sc'>Whitaker</span>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Let it not be thought that Fig, among his many antagonists, was without
a rival. Sutton, the Gravesend Pipemaker, already mentioned, publicly
dared the mighty Fig to the combat, and met him with alternate success, till
a third trial “proved the fact” of Fig’s superiority. These contests, though
given in all the “Chronologies” and “Histories” of the Ring, were neither
more nor less than cudgel-matches, as will be seen by the subjoined contemporary
verses by Dr. John Byrom. They are printed in “Dodsley’s Collection,”

judgment, conspired to form a matchless master. There was a majesty shone
in his countenance, and blazed in all his actions, beyond all I ever saw. His
right leg bold and firm, and his left, which could hardly ever be disturbed,

one of our travelling nobility, whose name not being recorded we may set down
this part of the story as apocryphal; in fact, as a managerial trick to attract
aristocratic patronage. Be that as it may, this immense fellow, who was
known by the name of “The Gondolier,” was celebrated for feats of strength:
his fame ran before him, and his length of arm and jaw-breaking power of
fist were loudly trumpeted. Indeed, a challenge having been issued by
the backers of the Venetian, Fig was applied to to find a man to meet this
Goliath. The sequel shall be told in Captain Godfrey’s own words:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bob Whitaker was the man pitched upon to fight the big Venetian. I
was at Slaughter’s Coffee-house when the match was made by a gentleman of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>advanced station: he sent for Fig to procure a proper man for him. He told
him to take care of his man, because it was for a large sum; and the Venetian
was of wonderful strength, and famous for breaking the jawbone in boxing.
Fig replied, in his rough manner, ‘I do not know, master, but he may break
one of his countrymen’s jawbones with his fist; but I’ll bring him a man,
and he shall not be able to break his jawbone with a sledge hammer.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The battle was fought at Fig’s amphitheatre, before a splendid company,
the politest house of that kind I ever saw. While the Gondolier was stripping
my heart yearned for my countryman. His arm took up all observation;
it was surprisingly large, long, and muscular. He pitched himself
forward with his right leg, and his arm full extended; and, as Whitaker
approached, caught him a blow at the side of the head which knocked him
quite off the stage, which was remarkable for its height. Whitaker’s misfortune
in his fall was the grandeur of the company, on which account they
suffered no common people in, that usually sat on the ground, and lined the
stage all round. It was thus all clear, and Whitaker had nothing to stop
him but the bottom. There was a general foreign huzza on the side of the
Venetian, as proclaiming our countryman’s downfall; but Whitaker took no
more time than was required to get up again, when, finding his fault in
standing out to the length of the other’s arm, he, with a little stoop, dashed
boldly in beyond the heavy mallet, and with one English peg in the stomach,”
by which the captain in another place explains he means what is called “the
mark,”—“quite a new thing to foreigners, brought him on his breech. The
blow carried too much of the English rudeness with it for him to bear, and
finding himself so unmannerly used, he scorned to have any more doings with
such a slovenly fist.” We could not resist transcribing this graphic, terse,
and natural account of a prize-fight; the rarity of Captain Godfrey’s book,
and the bald, diluted, silly amplification of it in “Boxiana,” pp. 22‒25,
vol. i., being the moving reasons thereto.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So fine a house,” says Captain Godfrey, alluding to the company which
assembled to see Whitaker fight the Gondolier, “was too engaging to Fig
not to court another. He therefore stepped up, and told the gentlemen that
they might think he had picked out the best man in London on this occasion;
but to convince them to the contrary, he said, that if they would come on
that day se’nnight, he would bring a man who should beat this Whitaker in
ten minutes by fair hitting. This brought near as great and fine a company
as the week before. The ‘man’ was Nathaniel Peartree, who, knowing the
other’s bottom, and his deadly way of flinging, took a most judicious manner
to beat him. Let his character come in here.—He was an admirable boxer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and I do not know one he was not a match for, before he lost his finger. He
was famous, like Pipes, for fighting at the face, but was stronger in his
blows. He knew Whitaker’s hardiness, and, being doubtful of beating him,
cunningly determined to fight at his eyes. His judgment carried his arm so
well, that, in about six minutes, both Whitaker’s eyes were shut; when,
groping about a while for his man, and finding him not, he wisely gave out
(<em>modernicè</em>, gave in), with these odd words—‘Damme, I’m not beat; but
what signifies my fighting when I can’t see my man?’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The columns of the <cite>Flying Post</cite> and <cite>Daily News Letter</cite> have many advertisements
of “battles royal,” but none of sufficient merit to deserve a place
in this history.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOM PIPES AND GEORGE GRETTING—1724‒1734.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Two other pugilists only of the school of Fig claim our notice, and these
are Pipes and Gretting. “Pipes was the neatest boxer I remember. He put
in his blows about the face (which he fought at most) with surprising time
and judgment. He maintained his battles for many years with extraordinary
skill, against men of far superior strength. Pipes was but weakly made:
his appearance bespoke activity, but his hand, arm, and body were small;
though by that acquired spring of his arm he hit prodigious blows; and at
last, when he was beat out of his championship, it was more owing to his
debauchery than the merit of those who beat him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a moral in the downfall of Gretting, as tersely given by Captain
Godfrey:—“Gretting was a strong antagonist to Pipes. They contended
together for some time, and were almost alternate victors. Gretting had the
nearest way of going to the stomach (which is what they call the ‘mark’) of
any man I knew. He was a most artful boxer, much stronger made than Pipes,
and dealt the straightest blows. But what made Pipes a match for him, was
his rare bottom spirit, which would bear a great deal of beating; and this, in
my mind, Gretting was not sufficiently furnished with; for after he was beaten
twice by Pipes, a mere sloven of a boxer, and everybody that fought him
afterwards beat him. I must, notwithstanding, do that justice to Gretting’s
memory to own that his debauchery contributed to spoil a great boxer; yet,
I think, he had not the bottom of the other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the opinion throughout Europe, at this period, that the English
nation were more expert than any other, not only in boxing, but in the use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of the back-sword; and sorry should we be were it not so at this day. The
amphitheatre, boxing, foil-play, and cudgelling-schools, were openly advertised,
and the amusements made known, like any of the regular theatres; the
audiences were equally fashionable, and they were patronised by the noble
and great, and not disturbed by the magistrates. Although it was admitted
that these amphitheatrical practices were productive of some ill, as offering
encouragement to idleness and extravagance among the vulgar, yet there is
hardly any useful thing that does not present some opening for mischief, or
is not liable to abuse.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>On the decease of Fig the immediate patrons of pugilism seem to have
cooled in their ardour, as we hear but little of the doings at the amphitheatre.
For four years George Taylor was his successor, and in 1740 we
find him assuming the title of “Champion,” and proprietor of the “Great
Booth in Tottenham Court Road.” With regard to the title of “Champion,”
at this period, and for nearly a century subsequent, it was assumed by and
applied to almost every boxer who challenged publicly. We make this
remark to clear the way for some observations we shall make upon George
Taylor’s defeat by the renowned Broughton. There is some curious blundering
about the date of the first fight between George Taylor and Broughton;
indeed, we should feel inclined to say that his first defeat was much earlier
than the date of 1740, which is given in all the Chronologies, John Bee’s
“Fistiana” and “Boxiana” included. He was proprietor of the “Great
Booth” from 1734, and we have Captain Godfrey’s authority for saying that
“he was not, when he fought Broughton, more than twenty years old,” and
comments on the imprudence of such “a first attempt.” It will be seen, too,
in the Life of Broughton, that the Captain speaks (writing in 1746‒7) thus of
Broughton—“for seventeen or eighteen years he has fought, etc., and never
been beaten.” From this we may fairly infer that it was some years prior to
1740 that Broughton first defeated George Taylor. Taylor, whose portrait is
certainly good-humoured and prepossessing, is described as being a “strong,
able pugilist,” according to the fashion of those times, but shifty and “deficient
in bottom.” George’s skill in the “cross-buttock fall” is also recorded,
and his cleverness in the “hanging-guard” and “back-sword” favourably
spoken of. With these qualifications he entered Fig’s amphitheatre, and seems
almost immediately to have become its proprietor. His advertisements invite
“champions” of the different branches of “self-defence” to come and display
their skill. The terms were that the proprietor should take one-third of the
door-money, and the remaining two-thirds be divided among the “champions,”
at the rate of one-third to the loser and two-thirds to the winner. We are
told the entrance-money often reached £150, and occasionally it was more.
Among the more noted boxers who illustrated the art at George Taylor’s
“great booth,” were the renowned Jack Broughton the waterman, the
Father of the English P.R., who beat all opposed to him, especially George
Taylor himself; Prince Boswell, Stevenson the coachman, Will Willis, Tom
Smallwood, Buckhorse, Jack James, Field the sailor, Pipes and Gretting
already mentioned, and others of the school of Fig.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>One of the most remarkable battles at Taylor’s booth was that of Broughton
and Stevenson, April 24, 1741 (see <span class='sc'>Life</span> of <span class='sc'>Broughton</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>, p. 22).</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 16th of June, 1741, George Taylor met a formidable gipsy, known
as Prince Boswell. He appears to have been a tricky fighter, and, like most
such over-clever pugilists, deficient in pluck. He had, we are told, a terrific
hit with his left (when he could plant it), but this being forbid by George’s
skill, he made but a poor fight of it. Captain Godfrey says of this Bohemian,
who is stated in “Pancratia” to have been son to the king of that wandering
people, “Praise be to his power of fighting, his excellent choice of time and
measure, his superior judgment despatching forth his executing arm! But
fie upon his dastard heart, that mars it all! As I knew that fellow’s abilities,
and his worm-dread soul, I never saw him beat but I wished him to be
beaten. Though I am charmed with the idea of his power and manner of
fighting, I am sick at the thoughts of his nurse-wanting courage. Farewell
to him, with this fair acknowledgment, that, if he had true English bottom
(the best fighting epithet for a man of spirit), he would carry all before him,
and be a match even for Broughton himself.” Despite of all these qualifications,
the Gipsy lost heart at finding Taylor so difficult to get at, and surrendered
after a few sharp rounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 19th of July, 1741, we find recorded the name of Jack James, as
beating one Chicken Harris, a poulterer, after a severe though short battle.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tom Smallwood</span>, too, was one of Taylor’s team. On the 23rd of November,
1741, one of the severest boxing matches that had taken place for years was
fought between Tom Smallwood and Richard Harris, a backmaker, for fifty
guineas. The fight lasted an hour, with many alternations of success, Smallwood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>proving the winner. Smallwood was a mere stripling, as we shall
note hereafter.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the same day we find a very good bye-battle was fought between Buckhorse
and Harry Gray, the clogmaker (see <span class='sc'>Buckhorse</span>, post).</p>

<p class='c007'>The advertisements and challenges of the boxers of this period are matters
of curiosity, as illustrating the manners of another age; we therefore insert
a few which have been preserved in connexion with this period of Taylor’s
career</p>

the <em>Jumping Sailor</em>, that he was not able to <em>move</em>, much more to <em>jump</em>, for
some time. Paddy gave him a <em>Tipperary fling</em>, which so completely <em>shook</em>
all his recollection out of him, that he never troubled the town afterwards
with any of his <em>epistolary</em> challenges!” For all which Hibernian <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">perfervidum
ingenium</span></i> we have no authority on record. The “Chronologies” say “Henley
bt. Francis (J.),” we suppose on the faith of the accuracy of “Boxiana.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>In the year 1742 differences arose between Broughton, now in the highest
favour with the Duke William of Cumberland (afterwards so fatally known
at Culloden in the year ’46), and other distinguished patrons of the Ring.
The schism, which was fatal to George Taylor’s establishment, will be noticed
in our <span class='sc'>Life</span> of <span class='sc'>Broughton</span>, and ended in Taylor’s joining Broughton’s company
of “champions” in 1744‒5, after a sounding challenge to that boxer.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this period George Taylor appears to have held his own in numerous
displays, but nothing of importance occurred till his memorable battle with
<span class='sc'>Slack</span> (see <span class='sc'>Slack</span>), a butcher from Norwich, afterwards so renowned for his
conquest of the great Broughton. Taylor’s battle with Slack has come down
with no details, farther than that it lasted twenty-five minutes, and was a
display of steady coolness and science over rushing impetuosity. Slack
proved an awkward fellow to keep off, but George was too wary, and in less
than half-an-hour the butcher was beaten to a stand-still.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the patrons of “the noble art,” during the period of George
Taylor’s proprietorship of the Great Booth, may be numbered Frederick,
Prince of Wales, the father of George the Third, before whom we may
fairly infer Taylor many times exhibited. It was not then the custom,
except incidentally, to give the people anything like our present “Court
Circular,” thus keeping the general public <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au courant</span></i> to the movements
of royalty and its branches. We find, however, among the works of Paul
Whitehead, the poet, who is styled by Captain Thompson, his biographer,
“<cite>The Champion</cite> and Bard of Leicester House,”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c009'><sup>[17]</sup></a> a poem entitled, “The
Gymnasiad, or Boxing Match.” It is printed entire in the edition of his
collected works. Dodsley, London, 1777.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taylor, when he retired from the stage, became landlord of the Fountain
Inn at Deptford. But as the old war-horse is said to prick his ears at the
sound of the trumpet, so, although declining in the vale of years, he replied
to the challenge of Tom Faulkner, “the noted cricketer.” Tom, it appears,
had twice been worsted by Taylor, in bygone days; yet he felt so confident
he could reverse the verdict, that he challenged George for 200 guineas and
“the gate money.” They met on August the 5th, 1758, at a mile and
a-half from St. Alban’s, Herts. The betting was three to one on Taylor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>who is called in the account “the old successor of Fig.” It would appear
that there was “no love lost” between the combatants. It was a complete
hammering set-to. For the first twelve or thirteen rounds, Faulkner was
dreadfully punished and floored several times. The fourteenth round proved
a proper trial of skill and strength; at length, Faulkner levelled Taylor,
when the odds began to drop a little, and Faulkner was getting into favour.
George, finding that his man gained upon him, began to shift, and fell now
and then without a blow, which occasioned considerable murmuring, and the
friends of Faulkner insisted that he had won the battle; but Faulkner was
above taking any advantage and wished to fight it out. The combatants
set-to more furiously than ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taylor, inspired with the thought of his fame and former victories, stood
up like a hero; and Faulkner, recollecting that it must either make or break
him, fought like a lion. After a terrible conflict of an hour and fifteen
minutes, the veteran George Taylor acknowledged he was conquered.
Greater courage and skill could not be displayed; and it was supposed, that
had not Taylor laboured under the manifest disadvantage of an eye of which
he had been blind for some time, Faulkner could not have beaten him; as the
contest was only put an end to by Taylor having the other eye closed from a
blow. The veteran hero thus added another to the list of great men who
have “lingered too long upon the stage,” or returned to exhibit those powers
in their decadence which were admired in their prime. “We shall have many
occasions in the course of this history to show the unconsciousness of decaying
powers among the heroes of the ring. George Taylor did not recover the
shock of this defeat, and died in the December following (1758) at his house
at Deptford.”</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>JACK BROUGHTON (CHAMPION)—1734‒1750.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Broughton is indisputably entitled to be regarded as the founder of the
modern art of self-defence. The successor of Fig in popularity, he far
exceeded that stalwart cudgeller in fistic science, and in the application of
those principles which stripped the practice of boxing of many of those
features of ruffianism and barbarity with which the unregulated contests
of mere bruisers had invested it. There was a neatness and quickness in his
style which far distanced his competitors, and drew crowds to witness his
exhibitions. He appears first to have introduced stopping and barring blows,
then hitting and getting away; before him it appears to have been toe-to-toe
work, or downright hammering; at any rate, his method appears to have
had the novelty of a discovery with his spectators and his antagonists. He
stopped the blows aimed at any part of him by his adversaries with so much
skill, and hit his man away with so much ease, that he astonished and
daunted his opponents, and those persons who had the temerity to enter the
lists with Broughton, were soon convinced of his superior knowledge and
athletic prowess: while most of his competitors, who were compelled to give
in from their exhausted and beaten state, had the mortification to behold
Broughton scarcely touched, displaying as much cheerfulness and indifference
as if he had scarcely been engaged in a set-to.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was indebted to nature for a good person; his countenance was manly
and open, possessing a sharp and penetrating eye, that almost looked through
the object before him, which gave animation to his face. His form was
athletic and commanding, and denoted uncommon strength. Every spectator
felt impressed who beheld him. Six feet, wanting an inch, in height, and
fourteen stone, or thereabouts, in weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Broughton became as a fixed star in the pugilistic hemisphere, His
talents as a boxer gained him many admirers and patrons; but his good
temper, generosity of disposition, and gentleness of manners, ensured him
numerous friends. He was intelligent, communicative, and not destitute of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>wit. The system he laid down was plain, and easy to be understood; and,
under his instruction, several of his pupils arrived at pugilistic eminence,
and gave distinguished proofs of the acquirements they had gained under so
great a master.</p>

<p class='c007'>Broughton was still, up to 1742, an exhibitor at the Great Booth of
George Taylor; we shall, therefore, before giving an account of his adventures
“on his own hook,” turn to his exploits at the Tottenham Court Road
establishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like all great masters, Broughton, we learn, always exhibited something
new in his several contests; and those pugilists who had seen him fight, and
supposed they had observed his method, were awfully deceived when they
entered the lists with him, and expected to “nail” him on “the old suit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Contrary to most other boxers, he did not depend upon any particular
blow, although he was distinguished for giving some remarkable hits, which
were not easily forgotten. Broughton, when necessary in the conflict, by
putting in “<em>his</em> stomach blow,” often decided the battle; and his lunge
under the ear generally produced terrible consequences to his opponent. The
eye of Broughton was lively, piercing, and acute, soon perceiving the weakness
of any adversary; his arm, keeping pace with that valuable assistant,
protected him from the most destructive blows; and his quick penetration
made him always aware of any direct intent pursued by his adversary, so as
immediately to render it unavailing. His guard was so complete, that his
frame appeared secured as if in a fence, uncommon strength and bottom
often fell before him, and his expertness in the cross-buttock was great.
His various attitudes in the fight were fine and impressive, and his countenance
always animated and cheerful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pipes and Gretting, already named, both distinguished pugilists—the
former of whom hardily maintained the title of a “Champion” for a number
of years—appeared nothing in the hands of Broughton, who gave them
several chances to recover their lost laurels; these each proved beatings to
them, and tended to increase his growing fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>George Taylor, of whom honourable mention has been made, fell as a
conquest to Broughton.</p>

having that regard for his preparation which he afterwards found he ought
to have had. But here his true bottom was proved, and his conduct shone
and admired. The battle was fought in one of the fair booths at Tottenham
Court Road, railed at the end towards the pit. After a most desperate conflict
of thirty-five minutes, being both against the rails, and the coachman
endeavouring to get the whip-hand of Broughton, the latter, by his superior
genius, got such a lock upon Stevenson as no mathematician could have
devised a better. There he held him by this artificial lock, depriving him of
all power of rising or falling, till resting his head for about three or four
minutes upon his back, he found himself recovering, then loosed his hold.
By this manœuvre Broughton became as a new man, and, on setting-to
again, he gave the coachman a tremendous blow, as hard as any he had
given him in the whole battle, so that he could no longer stand, and his
brave contending heart, though with reluctance, was forced to yield.
Stevenson was a beautiful hitter; he put in his blows faster than Broughton,
but then one of the latter’s told for three of the former’s. Stevenson had
a most daring spirit, but his strength could not keep pace with it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Broughton expressed a very high opinion of Stevenson as a pugilist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jack James, a dashing boxer, who ranked high in the annals of pugilism
as a thorough-bred man, was compelled to acknowledge that he had found
his master in Broughton. James’s wrist, which in other contests had been
considered so remarkably “handsome,” lost its attraction when in contact
with the athletic arm of Broughton.</p>

<p class='c007'>We need not proceed further with an enumeration of his earlier contests,
but come at once to his appearance at his own theatre, in the character of
<span class='sc'>Champion of England</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have noticed his differences with George Taylor. Broughton was
promised liberal support and patronage if he would open a theatre for the
better accommodation of the admirers of boxing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the patronage we have already spoken of, Broughton seceded from
the Tottenham Court Road establishment, rapidly completing a new building
adjoining the Oxford Road, near the spot where Hanway Street, Oxford
Street, now stands, and opened it on March 10th, 1743, with the subjoined
advertisement in the <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>. From prints yet existing in the
British Museum, it appears that this edifice was somewhat similar to Astley’s
original circus and riding school, in the Westminster Road, or rather the
large temporary and removable theatres, which have of late travelled with
equestrian exhibitions round our principal provincial towns. There were
boxes, pit, and a gallery; a stage for the combatants in the centre of the
ring, and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> bore some resemblance to the pictures of the Old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Fives Court, in Windmill Street. The following is a copy of the announcement:—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The appearance of this rival was a cruel blow to George Taylor, who saw
the ruinous results which must ensue to his “booth” from Broughton’s
popularity: he, therefore, as a counter hit, instantly let fly in the following
terms:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div><span class='sc'>To the Patrons and Encouragers of the Manly Art of Boxing.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Whereas, Mr. Broughton, well knowing that I was to fight Mr. Field on Tuesday next, the
13th of March, 1743, in order to injure me, has maliciously advertised to open his Amphitheatre
on that day, and where several battles are then to be fought. To prevent the public
from being deceived, I feel it my duty to inform them, that the principal part of the persons
mentioned were never made acquainted with such circumstances, and have no intention of so
doing. Mr. Broughton wishes to make it appear that he never imposed upon any of the
pugilists who had been concerned with him in any transaction whatever; but his imposition
shall soon be made manifest to the world. And to show Mr. Broughton that I have no
animosity against him as a pugilist, or any jealousy concerning his amphitheatre, I am
willing to fight him, as soon as he may think proper, wherever it may please him, not
regarding, as he loudly sets forth, the strength of his arm.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>George Taylor.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We are inclined to suspect that there was a little “gag” in the names of
the pugilists set forth by Broughton, from subsequent occurrences; be that as
it may, Taylor had already fallen beneath his conquering fist, and his
challenge was viewed as nothing more than mere bounce, to detract from the
triumph of the rival manager.</p>

<p class='c007'>The charges of Taylor, made from time to time, led to a sort of paper war.
Taylor charged Broughton with appropriating to himself the “Lion’s Share”
of the door-money, to the injury of the other pugilists. This accusation
Broughton replied to by showing to the satisfaction of his patrons that he
had not received one hundred pounds; that his amphitheatre had cost him
upwards of £400; that he had appropriated but a third part of the door-money
for his own individual emolument, and that the rest had been shared
among the pugilists. This account proving satisfactory, firmly established
Broughton; and Taylor, perceiving that it would be useless to oppose so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>powerful an opponent, relinquished his booth, and was engaged at the
Amphitheatre, where the most noted of his “merry men” followed him,
under an engagement to fight on no stage but his.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now come to one of the most important epochs in the history of
boxing, namely the promulgation of a “Code” for the guidance of the
combatants, and the satisfaction of the judges. These rules were “produced
by Mr. Broughton, for the better regulation of the Amphitheatre, and
approved of by the gentlemen, and agreed to by the pugilists, August 18th,
1743.” The code promulgated by this Fistic Napoleon, whose law-making
and fall were much like those of his great successor, had a much longer
duration than the “Code Napoleon!” for they lasted in perfect integrity
from the period of their date until 1838, when, after the fight between Owen
Swift and Brighton Bill, the “New Rules of the Ring” superseded Broughton’s.
We here give the original—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>BROUGHTON’S RULES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>1. That a square of a yard be chalked in the middle of the stage; and every fresh set-to
after a fall, or being parted from the rails, each second is to bring his man to the side of the
square, and place him opposite to the other; and till they are fairly set-to at the lines, it
shall not be lawful for the one to strike the other.</p>

<p class='c018'>2. That, in order to prevent any disputes as to the time a man lies after a fall, if the second
does not bring his man to the side of the square, within the space of half a minute, he shall
be deemed a beaten man.</p>

<p class='c018'>3. That, in every main battle, no person whatever shall be upon the stage, except the
principals and their seconds; the same rule to be observed in bye-battles, except that in the
latter, Mr. Broughton is allowed to be upon the stage to keep decorum, and to assist gentlemen
in getting to their places; provided always, he does not interfere in the battle; and
whoever presumes to infringe these rules, to be turned immediately out of the house.
Everybody is to quit the stage as soon as the champions are stripped, before they set-to.</p>

<p class='c018'>4. That no champion be deemed beaten, unless he fails coming up to the line in the
limited time; or that his own second declares him beaten. No second is to be allowed to
ask his man’s adversary any questions or advise him to give out.</p>

<p class='c018'>5. That, in bye-battles, the winning man to have two-thirds of the money given, which
shall be publicly divided upon the stage, notwithstanding any private agreement to the
contrary.</p>

<p class='c018'>6. That to prevent disputes, in every main battle, the principals shall, on the coming on
the stage, choose from among the gentlemen present two umpires, who shall absolutely
decide all disputes that may arise about the battle; and if the two umpires cannot agree, the
said umpires to choose a third, who is to determine it.</p>

<p class='c018'>7. That no person is to hit his adversary when he is down, or seize him by the ham, the
breeches, or any part below the waist: a man on his knees to be reckoned down.</p>

<p class='c013'>These rules may be called the groundwork of fair play and manly boxing,
and no man, from his experience, was better able to frame such a code than
Broughton. “It is to be observed,” says the talented author of ‘Fistiana’
(V. G. Dowling, Esq.), “that to them we greatly owe that spirit of fair play
which offers so wide a contrast to the practices of barbarous ages, when every
advantage was admissible when brute strength or accidental casualties placed
a combatant in the power of his antagonist. It is to be lamented that, even
in modern times, the inhuman practices of uncivilised periods have subsisted
to a disgraceful extent, and hence we have heard of gouging, that is to say,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>forcing out the eye of an antagonist with the thumbs or fingers—purring,
kicking a man with nailed shoes as he lies on the ground, striking him in
vital parts below the waistband, seizing him when on his knees, and
administering punishment till life be extinct, and a variety of other savage
expedients by which revenge or passion has been gratified; and it is remarkable
that in those counties in which pugilism or prize-fights have been least
encouraged, these horrors have been most frequent. We refer to Lancashire
in particular, where, even to this day, that species of contest called up-and-down
fighting—that is, when a man is got down he is kept down and punished
till incapable of motion—is permitted with impunity, unless indeed the death
of the victim leads to the apprehension and trial of the survivor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The adoption of Broughton’s rules in the metropolis soon led to their
extensive dissemination in the provinces, and public boxing was thereby
stripped of half its evils; while in the adjustment of private quarrels, the
settlement of the simple issue of “which was the better man” after “a fair
stand up fight,” put an end to all bad feeling, and the conqueror or the
conquered submitted with a good grace to “the fate of war;” the strongest
proof of the effects of cultivation, and the best test of a manly and honourable
feeling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To Broughton, then,” continues Mr. Dowling, “is to be ascribed the
credit of two great reforms in the practice of pugilism, namely, the introduction
of science and humanity; and by the moral effects these inculcated, more
has been done to establish the high character of Englishmen for honour and
fair play, than by all the eloquence of the pulpit or the senate.” To
Broughton also do we owe the introduction of gloves, or mufflers, for conducting
mock combats or sparring matches, as they are now called, by which
men receive lessons without injury, or display the art of self-defence without
those painful consequences to which Captain Godfrey so willingly submitted,
and which he so feelingly describes, but which deterred young aspirants
from entering those arenas in which, after harmless initiation, they often
became distinguished adepts, or were prepared to take their own parts in
unavoidable encounters. Broughton thus announces his new invention in the
<cite>Daily Advertiser</cite> of February, 1747:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“Mr. Broughton proposes, with proper assistance, to open an academy at his house in the
Haymarket, for the instruction of those who are willing to be initiated in the mystery of
boxing, where the whole theory and practice of that truly British art, with all the various
stops, blows, cross-buttocks, etc., incident to combatants, will be fully taught and explained;
and that persons of quality and distinction may not be debarred from entering into a course
of those lectures, they will be given with the utmost tenderness and regard to the delicacy of
the frame and constitution of the pupil; for which reason mufflers are provided, that will
effectually secure them from the inconveniency of black eyes, broken jaws, and bloody noses.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We have said that Broughton’s original calling was that of a waterman;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>it appears that the interest of his royal patron made him one of the Yeomen
of the Guard to the King. He also accompanied the Duke of Cumberland on
a tour to the Continent, of which an anecdote is preserved, of which we may
say, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">si non è vero è ben trovato</span></i>. “At Berlin he saw the fine regiment of
Grenadiers raised by Frederick the Great. The champion was asked by his
patron what he thought of any of them for a <em>set-to</em>, when Broughton, with a
smile, instantly replied, ‘Why, your Royal Highness, I should have no
objection to fight the whole regiment, only be kind enough to allow me a
breakfast between each battle.’” Thomas Carlyle has omitted this.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus far, Broughton appears to have sailed on the wave of triumph. His
patrons were numerous and aristocratic; but the confidence which good
fortune begets was to prove to him a snare, as it has to many before and since.
Slack, a butcher, and a pugilist of some note, but who had already succumbed
to George Taylor, had, it appears, a quarrel with Broughton on a
race-course, which led to a threat on the part of the champion that he would
horsewhip Slack. The result was a challenge: Slack obtained friends, a
match was made for £200 a-side, and as the door money was included in the
sum contended for, it was estimated at £600 clear. Although properly
falling under the biography of Slack, we here give the battle, for the purpose
of rendering as complete as possible the history of the Father of Scientific
Pugilism.</p>

<p class='c007'>Broughton’s overweening confidence proved his ruin; for, as we learn
from a contemporary authority, “he refused to take training preparation,”
although “he had not fought for a long time.” Let others take warning by
his fall.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the evening previous to the battle (Tuesday, April 10, 1750) Broughton,
who had invited his patrons and numerous friends to witness the battle, was
rather apprehensive that Slack would not fight, and for fear any disappointment
should take place, made the latter a present of ten guineas not to break
his engagement.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first five minutes, Broughton’s superiority over Slack was so
evident, that the odds were ten to one in his favour; when Slack, recovering
a little from the effects of his antagonist’s blows, made a sudden and
unexpected jump, planting a desperate hit between the champion’s eyes,
which immediately closed them up. Broughton now appeared stupefied;
and as it was two or three minutes before the effects of this fatal blow were
manifest, the spectators were at a loss to account for the unusual movements
of Broughton, who appeared to feel for, instead of boldly facing and attacking
his man. At length his patron, the Duke of Cumberland, exclaimed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“What are you about, Broughton?—you can’t fight!—you’re beat!” To
which Broughton instantly replied, “I can’t see my man, your highness—I’m
blind, but not beat: only let me see my man, and he shall not gain the
day yet.” Broughton’s situation was truly distressing; and Slack, following
up this singular advantage, obtained a victory in fourteen minutes!</p>

<p class='c007'>The Duke appears to have been most unworthily angered at his loss,
which has been (we suspect extravagantly) stated to have amounted to
£10,000. He always declared he had been “sold.” There seems no cause
for such an assertion.</p>

<p class='c007'>This defeat proved Broughton’s ruin. The Duke of Cumberland could
never speak of this contest with any degree of temper, and turned his back
on the beaten man. The legislature interfered, the amphitheatre was closed,
and Broughton never fought more. Previous to this battle, it is said he had
grown plethoric; if so, it requires no great acumen to opine the cause of the
sudden swelling which temporarily blinded him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The best monument to the memory of Broughton is the character and
description of his pupil and admirer, the gallant Captain, which eulogy,
like that of Lord Byron on the “eminent” Mr. John Jackson, remain permanent
answers to the slanderers of pugilists and pugilism.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Advance, brave Broughton!” exclaims Captain Godfrey. “Thee I
pronounce captain of the boxers. As far as I can look back, I think I ought
to open the ‘characters’ with him: I know none so fit, so able to lead up
the van. This is giving him the living preference to the rest; but I hope I
have not given any cause to say that there has appeared in any of my
characters a partial tincture. I have thoroughly consulted nothing but my
unbiassed mind, and my heart has known no call but merit. Wherever
I have praised, I have no desire of pleasing; wherever decried, no fear of
offending. Broughton, by his manly merit, has bid the highest, therefore
has my heart. I really think all will poll with me, who poll with the same
principle. Sure there is some standing reason for this preference: what can
be stronger than to say that, for seventeen or eighteen years, he has fought
every able boxer that appeared against him, and has never yet been beat?
This being the case, we may venture to conclude from it; but not to build
alone on this, let us examine farther into his merits. What is it that he
wants? Has he not all that others want, and all the best can have?
Strength equal to what is human, skill and judgment equal to what can be
acquired, undebauched wind, and a bottom spirit never to pronounce the
word ‘enough.’ He fights the stick as well as most men, and understands
a good deal of the small sword. This practice has given him the distinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>of time and measure beyond the rest. He stops as regularly as the swordsman,
and carries his blows truly in the line; he steps not back, distrusting
of himself, to stop a blow, and puddle in the return, with an arm unaided by
his body, producing but fly-flap blows, such as pastrycooks use to beat those
insects from their tarts and cheese-cakes. No! Broughton steps bold and
firmly in, bids a welcome to the coming blow; receives it with his guardian
arm; then, with a general summons of his swelling muscles, and his firm
body seconding his arm, and supplying it with all its weight, pours the pile-driving
force upon his man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That I may not be thought particular in dwelling long upon Broughton,
I leave him with this assertion, that as he, I believe, will scarce trust a
battle to a waning age, I never shall think he is to be beat till I see him
beaten.”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c009'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Broughton retired into private life. In his later days he resided in Walcot
Place, Lambeth. He was for many years seen as a constant frequenter of
sales of private property, where he purchased out-of-the-way things, curiosities,
and articles of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vertu</span></i>, and adhered to the costume of the period of the
Second George. Of these habits the author of “Recollections of an Octogenarian,”
gives us the following information:—“He appeared to me,” says
the writer, “a heavy, thick, round-made, large-boned man, about the height
of Humphries.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c009'><sup>[19]</sup></a> To be sure when I saw him last he was in the vale of
years, and had acquired some corpulency. It might be about the year 1785,
when attending a lady, to look at some household goods, which were to be
sold by auction in Walcot Place, Lambeth, a catalogue could not be procured,
and seeing Broughton with one in his hand, I civilly requested the favour of
him to permit the lady to look at a certain article in it. The old man
replied with a sullen asperity of countenance, ‘I want it myself,’ turning his
back upon me. At the instant, up started a little, pert, natty, humorous
Jew broker, who, with real politeness, made the lady an offer of his catalogue,
and casting an arch look at the testy old champion, who was still
close to us, ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘Master Broughton, then you are a <em>bear</em> to-day,’
alluding to the bulls and bears of Change Alley, where Broughton was well
known to be daily jobbing with his property.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Octogenarian” confirms the statement given below from the <cite>Annual
Register</cite>:—“He (Broughton) had long before left the ring, and lived independently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>on the property he had saved, and on an annuity which he enjoyed
from his Royal Master, the old, or Culloden, Duke of Cumberland, whom, by
the bye, he used in former days to style ‘Duke William.’” <cite>Boxiana</cite> says he
died January the 8th, 1789, but this can hardly be the correct date. In the
<cite>Annual Register</cite> for 1789, Chronicle for January, we read as follows:—“Died,
at his house, at Walcot Place, Lambeth, in his 85th year, the celebrated John
Broughton, whose skill in boxing is well known, and will ever be recorded in
the annals of that science. He was originally bred a waterman. His patron,
the late Duke of Cumberland, got him appointed one of the yeomen of the
guard, which place he enjoyed till his death. He was buried in Lambeth
Church on the 21st instant, and his funeral procession was adorned with the
presence of the several capital professors of boxing. He is supposed to have
died worth £7,000.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His enjoyment of his place and pension till death seems to qualify the
“utter desertion” of his patron, and falsify the “ruin” which is related in
<cite>Boxiana</cite> apparently to “adorn a tale,” if not “to point a moral.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Though the prestige of Broughton has gone far to illustrate the name of
his conqueror, this lucky, rather than skilful, achievement will not give him
the place he deserves among boxers with those with whom success is not
“the be-all and end-all” in war or in worldly fortune. Slack fought better
battles than that in which he tore the laurel from the brow of the veteran
Broughton. We read of him in a contemporary journal:—“Slack is a
butcher from Norwich; his height is five feet eight inches and a half, and
his weight nearly fourteen stone. He is remarkably compact” (we should
think so at fourteen stone for so short a man), “superior to the generality of
men in strength, and of excellent bottom. His method of hitting is not
regular, and he seldom fights on a preconcerted plan; but his style being
suited to the man contending with him, few were able to resist him, when he
resolved on victory. His blows were usually given with such force, that his
name ‘Slack’ passed into a slang expression, and ‘a slack’un’ meant a
smashing hit. His attitude was remarkably upright, legs little separated,
the right hand covering the pit of the stomach, and the left placed immediately
before the mouth.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c009'><sup>[20]</sup></a> It is not possible to distinguish much science
in such an attitude, and had he not been more resolute in attack, and more
game in taking punishment than his opponents, he might have missed the
proud title of champion. We are told, “with the greatest resolution he
disputed every inch of ground, and was so averse to shifting or retreating,
that he has risked and received a knock-down blow rather than give up his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>position. Slack frequently used the <em>chopper</em>,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c009'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and generally with success
(this says little for his opponents’ defence), in a return. Bringing his fist to his
breast, and projecting his elbow, he threw off a blow describing a segment of
a circle(!), the centre of which was the elbow, unexpectedly striking his
antagonist in the face with the back of his hand. This mode was completely
his own, but has since been adopted by many.” (“Pancratia,” p. 40). We
do not know that we have ever read more nonsense in as many lines; but
this is not the place for a treatise on the art.</p>

<p class='c007'>Slack, after numerous victories in the provinces, came up to Broughton’s
booth, about 1748, to try his fortune. It may interest some of our readers
to see a challenge of the day in which John Slack figures as the respondent.
The advertisement is curious.</p>

<p class='c020'><em>October 30, 1744.—At the Castle, in Framlingham, in Suffolk, on Monday, the 12th day of
November next ensuing, there will be a severe trial of manhood between the following
Champions, viz.</em>,</p>

<p class='c018'>I, <span class='sc'>Daniel Smith</span>, the Suffolk Champion, do once more invite Mr. John Slack, the
Norfolk Champion, to meet and fight me at the time and place above said, for the sum of
forty guineas: and though I had the misfortune to be defeated by him before, am sure I
am much superior in the art of boxing, and doubt not but I shall give him and the company
entire satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c018'>I, <span class='sc'>John Slack</span>, the Norfolk Champion, do accept the above challenge, and will be certain
to meet and fight the above hero for the said sum, at the time and place above mentioned;
and don’t doubt but I shall support the character I have hitherto maintained.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c018'>N.B. They are to fight upon a stage, and galleries will be erected for the reception of

<p class='c018'>The doors will be opened at nine o’clock, and the champions mount the stage at one.</p>

<p class='c013'>It will be seen from this that Daniel Smith had already fallen before
Slack’s ponderous arm. When and where we have found no record. That
on this occasion he again made the Suffolk champion strike his colours, may
be fairly assumed from the fact that when, after some successes over inferior
boxers, he had the audacity to challenge George Taylor himself, it is recorded
as Slack’s first defeat. “He had not been hitherto beaten.” The battle, as
already narrated, took place on the last day of January, 1750, at Broughton’s
amphitheatre, and was a desperate contest on the part of Slack, who rushed
in till he was punished to helplessness.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Shortly after this defeat Slack was present at Hounslow Races. Here a
dispute arose, in the course of which Broughton, considering Slack’s conduct
insolent, assumed a high tone of superiority, threatening to horsewhip “the
butcher” on the spot. With the merits of the quarrel we have nothing to
do. Slack, in whose composition there was certainly no fear of man, at once
challenged the redoubted and highly patronised waterman, who upon the
spot accepted the defiance. Some of the preliminary incidents of this
remarkable battle have been already touched upon in the memoir of Broughton.
That skilful boxer appears to have viewed the challenge of Slack with
a fatal self-confidence. Indeed, considering that Slack had recently surrendered
to Taylor, whose qualifications none knew better than Broughton,
who had long since defeated him, probably more than once, there was some
ground for confidence, and we have it on authority that he considered there
was no necessity for regular training, imperfectly as that process was carried
out at that period. We prefer copying an account from a paper of the
day, to the embellished apocrypha of later histories.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On Wednesday, April 11 (1750), was fought the grand boxing match
between the celebrated Broughton, hitherto invincible, and John Slack, the
Norfolk butcher. Before the battle began Broughton gave Slack ten guineas
to fight him, according to a previous promise, which Slack immediately
betted against one hundred guineas offered as odds against him. The first
two minutes the odds were ten to one in favour of Broughton; but Slack,
recovering himself, struck a blow which blinded his adversary, and following
up his advantage, obtained a complete victory in fourteen minutes, to the great
mortification of the knowing ones, including a peer of the first rank, who,
betting ten to one, lost £10,000. The money received at the doors was
£130, besides 200 tickets at a guinea and a half each; and as the battle was
for the whole house, it is supposed the victor cleared £600.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already said that the downfal of Broughton was the downfal of
public pugilism in the metropolis; whatever there was of good in the art to
a great extent perishing at the caprice of a prince and the power of a few
aristocrats. If these are necessary concomitants to its existence, it would not
have been worth preserving, but it has survived the frowns of power, and
had a better support in the favour of the people. If Broughton’s theatre
was closed, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ars pugnandi</span></i> dwelt in the provinces, and we find our hero
engaged in 1751 at Harlston, in Norfolk, with a gigantic Frenchman, whose
name, Petit or Pettit, almost savours of a jest. Pettit appears to have been
an exhibitor in a circus as a “strong man,” and was noted for immense
muscular powers. Of his boxing capabilities, like those of the Gondolier,
we cannot form a high estimate. The following letter appeared in the
papers of the time:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>Harlston, Norfolk, July 30th, 1751.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Yesterday, in the afternoon, Slack and Pettit met and fought. At the first set-to Pettit
seized Slack by the throat, held him up against the rails, and <em>grained</em><a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c009'><sup>[22]</sup></a> him so much as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>make him extremely black. This continued for half a minute, before Slack could break
from Pettit’s hold; after which, for near ten minutes, Pettit kept fighting and driving hard
at Slack, when at length Slack closed with his antagonist, and gave him a severe fall, after
that a second and a third, but between these falls, Pettit threw Slack twice off the stage;
indeed Pettit so much dreaded Slack’s falls, that he ran directly at his hams, and tumbled
him down,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c009'><sup>[23]</sup></a> and by that means gave Slack an opportunity of making the falls easy. When
they had been fighting 18 minutes the odds run against Slack, a guinea to a shilling;
whereas, on first setting out, it was three or four to one on his head; but after this time
Slack <em>shortened</em> Pettit so as to disable him from running and throwing him down in the
manner he had done before, but obliged him to stand to <em>close fighting</em>. Slack then closed one
of his eyes, and beat him very much about the face; at twenty minutes Pettit grew weaker
and Slack stronger. This was occasioned by Slack’s straight way of fighting. At twenty-two
minutes the best judges allowed Slack to have the advantage over Pettit very considerably,
as he was then <em>recovering his wind</em>, owing to his game qualities. When they had
boxed twenty-four minutes, Pettit once more threw Slack over the rails. This indeed Slack
allowed him to do, for as he got his hold, Slack fired a blow under Pettit’s ribs that hurt
severely. While Slack was again getting upon the stage (it was not half a minute before he
remounted), Pettit had so much the fear of his antagonist before his eyes, that he walked off
without so much as civilly taking leave of the spectators. The cockers call this rogueing it,
for it is generally thought that Pettit ran away full strong. The whole time of their
fighting was twenty-five minutes, and this morning the battle was judged to Slack, who
drew the first ten guineas out of the box.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the last sentence it would seem that there was a subscribed fund,
and principal and secondary prizes for the winners.</p>

<p class='c007'>We read in “Pancratia,” that “the name of Slack was, and not unjustly,
a terror to fightable rustics.” “At a country fair a ‘native,’ depending on his
natural prowess, gave Slack a blow in the face. We may presume it was
returned, and ‘a ring’ being called, a sharp set-to began. It is said the
countryman had the advantage, until Slack exclaimed with fervour, ‘What!
shall it be said a ploughman beat Jack Slack?’ The very name appalled the
countryman, who, imagining his antagonist had been playing with him, said,
‘Have I been fightin’ wi’ Slack? I’ll ha’ no more on’t.’ And he was as
good as his word, donning his clothes and leaving the field to the veteran
professional.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next recorded battle of Slack was for 100 guineas with Cornelius
Harris, a collier of Kingswood, near Bristol. It took place on the 13th of
March, 1755. The skill and tactics of Slack were severely tried, Harris
fighting desperately in Slack’s own early style for twenty minutes, when he
gave in.</p>

<p class='c007'>On October 20th, 1759, Slack is again recorded as victor in a fight for
£50 aside with one Moreton, who had issued a challenge to the champion.
It came off at Acton Wells. Moreton proved himself a courageous, if not a
good boxer; but at the end of thirty-five minutes he acknowledged his
mistake.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Ten years had now elapsed since Slack had vanquished the renowned
Broughton, and held the title of champion—but the honour was dazzling,
and another hero put in his claim for the towering prize. Slack’s fame was
well established; and here royalty once more appeared on the pugilistic
scene; for Broughton’s old patron, the Duke of Cumberland, stepped forward
and backed Slack for £100 against Bill Stevens, the Nailer, whom the Duke
of York took under his patronage. The Haymarket was the scene of action,
and a stage was erected in the Tennis Court, James Street, on the day of the
17th of June, 1760. Slack entered the field with all the confidence of a
veteran, and was acknowledged to have the advantage in the first part of the
battle; but the Nailer, with an arm like iron, received the ponderous blows
of his antagonist on his left with ease, while with his right arm he so
punished the champion’s nob, that he knocked off the title, picked it up, and
wore it. Thus fell the hitherto invincible Slack.</p>

<p class='c007'>This second great mistake of William of Cumberland seems to have disgusted
him with the ring, and we hear no more of him. The Duke of York
here spoken of was one of the uncles of George III., whose father, Frederick,
Prince of Wales, died in George II.’s lifetime.</p>

<p class='c007'>Slack now quitted the pugilistic profession, and returned to his old trade,
opening a butcher’s shop in Chandos Street, Covent Garden. Here he
carried on a good business, but still mixed himself in fistic matters. He backed
and trained George Meggs, of whom more anon, to fight Bill Stevens, his
conqueror, for the championship and 200 guineas. The fight came off on the
2nd of March, 1761, at the Tennis Court, St. James’ Street. The reporter
says, “At the first onset Stevens missed his blow, and Meggs struck him
that instant on the side of the head and knocked him down. This error
seems to have lost him the battle. After this the battle lasted seventeen
minutes, with scarcely a blow struck, when Stevens gave in.” We regret to
say that this disgraceful affair was clearly traced to Slack, who gave Stevens
50 guineas and his stake. “Pancratia” says: “An old supporter of
Stevens, meeting him one day, expressed his surprise at this defeat, when
Bill drily answered him, ‘Why, Lord bless you, the day I fought Jack
Slack I got 90 guineas; but I got 50 guineas more than I should otherwise
have done by letting Georgy beat me; and, damme, ain’t I the same man
still?’” The Nailer and Slack both fell into disrepute; but the latter stuck
to his business, and appears to have prospered until his death in 1778.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>BILL STEVENS THE NAILER (CHAMPION)—1760.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This tremendous boxer, whose courage found no counterpart in his honesty,
will aptly come in here. It would be tedious, could they even be dug up, to
give an outline of his many battles before his crowning victory over Slack,
with the exception of one, that with Jacob Taplin, the coal-eaver.</p>

<p class='c007'>The winter of 1760 was rendered memorable in the annals of pugilism by
a desperately contested battle, “fought in the month of February between
William Stevens the Nailer and Jacob Taplin. The site fixed on for deciding
the boxing match was the hollow known as Marylebone Basin, which held
about 3,000 spectators. A ring was formed in its centre, and the champions
commenced the combat. Taplin in the first rounds seemed to have much the
best of the Nailer, who received some tremendous blows in the ‘bread-basket,’
which had several times knocked him down. The last time Stevens seemed
to rise with the fury of a lion roused from slowness and placidity into excessive
irritation. He faced his antagonist and let fly, levelling him at his
feet. The odds, which had been in favour of Taplin, now became four to one
on Stevens. In the next round he repeated his knock-down by a tremendous
blow below the left breast. When Taplin rose next time, he closed on him
suddenly and both fell. The next round decided the battle in favour of
Stevens, who struck Taplin on the left eye with his left hand, while with
the other he followed it by a blow on the temple, which laid him senseless.
Taplin not being prepared in time to resume the contest, Stevens was declared
the victor.”—<cite>Daily Advertiser, Feb. 20, 1760.</cite></p>

<p class='c007'>And now the fame of Stevens running abroad he received the highest
patronage, and was matched for 100 guineas aside against the veteran champion
Slack. The result has been already told. He disabled Slack’s guard
by repeated and heavy blows on his left forearm, and followed them by a right
hand lunge at the head, accompanied by a trip at his left foot, which disturbed
the champion’s balance. In the words of the report, “he with his
right hand beat him about the head, while at the same time tripping him off
his centre with his foot.” The champion’s title fell to Stevens, but he did
not long wear it, through his own misconduct. The battle, or rather sham
fight at the Tennis Court with George Meggs, the collier, has been already
noticed. Stevens, after seventeen minutes of trickery, scarcely knowing how
to make a fight of it, gave in.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c009'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Stevens’ later fights were few. His backers had, of course, deserted him.
On July 4, 1769, we find as follows: “William Stevens, the Nailer, who
dexterously played the <em>cross</em> with George Meggs, fought a battle with
M’Guire, an Irish pugilist, on the green stage at the back of Montague
House. M’Guire was beaten.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stevens was also defeated by one Turner, but the date and circumstances
are not recorded. We learn this fact from the account of Turner’s victory
over Peter Corcoran, the Irish champion (Sept. 24, 1769).</p>

<p class='c007'>Stevens’ career closed in defeat and disgrace. Eighteen years after his
victory over Slack, he entered the ring with the rising Harry Sellers (see
<span class='sc'>Sellers</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>). Stevens added another illustration to the ring proverb—“Youth
will be served.” Had Stevens kept the straight course, he might
have emulated Taylor, Broughton, and Slack. The date of his death is
uncertain.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>THOMAS SMALLWOOD—1741‒1757.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Among the luminaries of George Taylor’s Great Booth, and subsequently
of Broughton’s Amphitheatre, Tom Smallwood, though never opposed to the
very foremost men of his time, was a ready and resolute boxer of no small
pretensions. Captain Godfrey has enshrined him in his curious pages, so
that entire omission of him would be inexcusable in these sketches of the
early heroes of the ring. “Had he but possessed weight (whence we may
infer he was what we should now call a ‘middle weight,’ say 11 stone), he
was capable of standing against any man.” It must be remembered that
“rushing,” and “hammering,” and “driving against the rails,” seem to
have been much in vogue in the stage encounters of the period; and the
preposterous weight of thirteen stone and a half and fourteen stone was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>thought advantageous for a man of five feet eight or nine inches! Smallwood’s
battles were numerous and creditable, whether in defeat or success.
His first battle recorded in the “Diurnals” was with one Dimmocks, a
powerful carman, at Taylor’s Booth, in May, 1741, the month after Broughton
had defeated Stevenson, the coachman. It was a desperate affair, and
well contested by Smallwood, then a youth. After three-quarters of an hour of
severe fighting, Smallwood was beaten by the superior strength of his opponent.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the following November Tom Smallwood again entered the lists with
Richard Harris, a brick-maker, for 50 guineas. It is described as “one
of the severest boxing matches that had taken place for many years,” and
“contested with alternate successes, with the greatest hardihood and intrepidity,
for one hour, when victory decided in favour of Smallwood.”
Broughton expressed a high opinion of the courage and skill of Smallwood.
The day was also noted for the first appearance of “Buckhorse” (John
Smith) upon this stage, who fought “a draw” with Harry Gray, the clogmaker.
See <span class='sc'>Buckhorse</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the notice of <span class='sc'>George Taylor</span> will be found a couple of specimens of his
booth advertisements. They contain the names of Tom Smallwood and Will
Willis (the Fighting Quaker). On this occasion (April 28, 1742) our hero
despised Willis, who derived his nickname from a remarkably plain and
formal appearance, and a sedateness of manner not common among “knights
of the fives,” with whom fun and flash appear to have been ever prevalent.
At this point, after an imaginary account of Smallwood’s victory, stuffed
with the slang of the first quarter of the present century, and bald attempts
at facetiousness, the “Historian” adds, “Tom Smallwood fought several
other battles, in <em>all</em> of which he proved victorious; but the combatants were
not of sufficient importance to claim mention.”—Boxiana, vol. i., p. 33. He
then proceeds, p. 67, to give a memoir of Edward Hunt, on whom he lavishes
just praises, and records his <em>defeat</em> by Smallwood, as one out of the many
specimens of <em>method</em> with which his hash is concocted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Smallwood, after the closing of Taylor’s Booth in 1744, does not appear
to have belonged to Broughton’s company, for we find him fighting one
King, a butcher, at Stanton Green, who beat him, in January, 1746. The
particulars of this battle are not recorded, but King is said to have also
“fought several good battles at the Booth.” There is something obscure
about this battle, as Captain Godfrey, writing in 1747, a constant visitor at
Broughton’s, and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au courant</span></i> with every man in the fistic world, says, “If
I was to choose a boxer for my money, and could but purchase him strength
equal to his resolution, Smallwood should be the man.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>The most remarkable of Smallwood’s triumphs was his victory over
Broughton’s favourite pupil and <em>protegé</em>, Edward Hunt, whose defeat of
Hawksley, the Life-guardsman, had made him the talk of the town. The
battle had been long talked of, and was fought on a stage at Hounslow,
July 14, 1757. The stake was 150 guineas. For thirty minutes the combat
was carried on with equal resolution, and without any leading advantage.
“For the first 35 minutes the odds were alternately on each man. After
this time, Tom, who was the heavier man, closed with Hunt more frequently,
and by superior strength followed it up with such advantage, that in 50
minutes the battle was decided in his favour.” Hunt is said to have
weighed but nine stone. Smallwood was seconded by “Old George Taylor,”
and Hunt by the champion, Jack Slack.</p>

<p class='c007'>Smallwood, who had now been at least seventeen years before the public,
seems to have retired a conqueror, as we have no further mention of his
name.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>EDWARD HUNT—1746‒1758.</h4>

<p class='c013'>This favourite pupil of Broughton continually appears in his master’s
advertisements. He was a boxer of first-rate science, as then practised,
with unquestionable courage, extreme hardihood, and remarkable activity.
Though barely five feet five inches, and weighing but nine stone, he often
fought and defeated men of large stature, and vastly his superiors in weight.
“Being constantly overmatched, he had more difficulties to encounter than
any other boxer on the list, and of the few instances of ‘shifting’ which
occurred in his time, he is the most singular, for he conquered the stoutest
men by his admirable art. With strength so much beyond his own opposed
to him he might have been allowed to drop, but he seldom fell without
a blow. He never confined himself to one attitude, for, being extremely
active, he found he could more effectually confuse his antagonist by continually
changing his guard. He endeavoured to avoid blows aimed at his
body by stepping aside, and then took an opportunity of dexterously ‘winding’
his man, who was driven forward by his own force. If a blow was
aimed at his head, he stooped to let his adversary’s arm pass over him,
and then succeeded in general in planting a good body blow. These
manœuvres proved highly advantageous to Hunt in his pugilistic career,
for his opponents became aware of these practices, and accordingly fought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>on the defensive, by which means he became the assailant, and avoided being
overwhelmed by their superior power.” This is the description of a consummate
boxer by a master hand; quoted in “Pancratia,” pp. 50, 51. “What a
picture of a combination of the styles of Young Dutch Sam and Bendigo!
With this before you read Pierce Egan’s stuff about Hunt’s not “fearing the
<em>disparagement</em> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>) between him and his <em>lofty</em> opponent,” and “stood up to
Hawksley prime as a <em>game</em> cock,” etc. The contemporary account of Hunt’s
battle with Hawksley is brief:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“On June 11th (1746) a very severe battle was contested at the Amphitheatre
between Edward Hunt, a pupil of Mr. Broughton’s, weighing only
nine stone,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c009'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and one Hawksley a Life-guardsman, who weighed seventeen
stone. The odds before fighting were ten to one in favour of Hawksley.
The battle lasted only ten minutes, during which the odds changed in favour
of Hunt, who was declared the victor.” This affair is most unaccountable;
shifting, and the “planting” of a nine stone man, could hardly have beaten
Hawksley in ten minutes, unless he was out of condition, drunk, or a coward.</p>

<p class='c007'>His next great battle was with Smallwood (1757), already narrated; and
his last recorded appearance was with Richard Mills, a game boxer, known
by the name of “the Onion Boy,” May 17, 1758, at Islington. After an
hour’s severe fighting, Hunt, upon whom large odds were betted, was compelled
to surrender.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BUCKHORSE (JOHN SMITH)—1732‒1746.</h4>

<p class='c013'>There was one pugilist of this period, whose name we rather introduce as
a remarkable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lusus naturæ</span></i> than as an illustrator of the noble art. This individual
was John Smith, more commonly known as <span class='sc'>Buckhorse</span>. The following
particulars are chiefly derived from a memoir which appeared in the
“Eccentric Magazine.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<p>BUCKHORSE (<span class='sc'>John Smith</span>), 1732‒1746.<br /><br /><em>After an Etching by</em> <span class='sc'>William Hogarth</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“<span class='sc'>Buckhorse</span>, whose real name is said to have been John Smith, first saw
the light in the house of a sinner, in that part of London known by the name
of Lewkner’s Lane, a place notorious in the extreme for the eccentricity of
the characters it contained: here the disciples of Bamfylde Moore Carew
were to be found in crowds, and cadgers of all descriptions resorted to regale
themselves upon the good things of this life, laughing at the credulity of the
public in being so easily duped by their impositions; and here the juvenile
prig was soon taught to become an adept in the profession, by taking out a
handkerchief or a snuff-box, from the pocket of a coat covered with bells,
without ringing any of them. In these slums the finished thief roosted from
the prying eyes of society, and laid plans for his future depredations.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It appears, then, that few places could boast of more originality of
character than that from which <span class='sc'>Buckhorse</span> sprang; and, from the variety
of talents here displayed, there is little doubt he did not remain long a
novice. As we have never been troubled with any account to what good-natured
personage he owed his origin, we cannot determine; but suffice it to
observe, that little <span class='sc'>Buckhorse</span> and his mother were turned out upon the
wide world, long before he knew its slippery qualities, by the cruel publican,
their landlord, which inhuman circumstance took place about the year 1720.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This freak of nature, it would seem, was indebted to his mother for what
little instruction he received, the principal of which was an extraordinary
volubility of speech; and from his early acquaintance with the streets he
picked up the rest of his qualifications.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Buckhorse’s composition, however rude and unsightly, was not without
harmony; and although his fist might not appear musical to his antagonist
by its potent touch, yet when applied to his own chin, was capable of producing
a variety of popular tunes, to the astonishment of all those who heard
and saw him, and by which peculiar trait he mostly subsisted, added to
selling little switches for a halfpenny a-piece, his cry of which was so
singular, that Shuter, the celebrated comedian, among his other imitations,
was more than successful in his mimicry of Buckhorse, which was repeatedly
called for a second time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As a pugilist, <span class='sc'>Buckhorse</span> ranked high for strength and endurance among
the boxers of the day, and displayed great muscular power in the battles he
contested.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boxiana” says, under date 1742, after the fight of Smallwood and
Willis, “About this time the noted Buckhorse fought Harry Gray, when the
latter got severely punished by this ugly customer.” It is true that this
battle took place in 1742, but if Mr. Egan had read Fig’s bill, which he
prints at p. 44, vol. i., he would have seen there that, ten years previous
(Sept. 18, 1732), it is announced that “<span class='sc'>Buckhorse</span> and several other pugilists
will show the art of boxing.” Unless the infant was eight years old in 1720,
he must have been “noted” enough to be specially underlined in capital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>letters at twelve years old! Fig died in 1734 (see p. 12, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>). Buckhorse
continues, too, it will be seen, in Broughton’s bill for his “New Amphitheatre,”
on the 13th of March, 1743 (p. 24, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>), and is there advertised,
not for a match among the eight men specially named as to be paired, but in
a singular manner, indicative of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i> rather than a boxing match. Thus:
“N.B. There will be a battle royal by the <span class='sc'>Noted Buckhorse</span> and seven or
<em>eight others</em>, after which there will be several <em>bye-battles</em> with others.”
Buckhorse seems to have fought previously in these bye-battles, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, that
with Harry Gray (who here appears among the men to be matched), two
years previously (23rd Nov., 1741), after Tom Smallwood had defeated
Harris. (See <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 38.)</p>

<p class='c007'>There is something truly Hogarthian in the portrait handed down to us;
and as he was a contemporary of “the valiant Fig,” it is no strained supposition
that it came originally from the great English master’s pencil, as well
as that of the champion himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As ugly as Buckhorse” was for a long time the uncomplimentary expression
for a remarkably ugly man. This singular being is said to have
been in the custom of allowing himself to be knocked down for a trifling
gratuity by any one who might fancy a trial of the strength of his own arm.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOM FAULKNER, THE CRICKETER—1758‒1791.</h4>

<p class='c013'>One of the best men of his day, and who divided his attention between the
two great English games, cricket and boxing, both, in a scientific form,
nearly contemporaneous, was Tom Faulkner. Twice, fired with the ambition
of holding the champion’s title, did he enter the lists with the renowned
George Taylor, and twice, after a good fight, he succumbed to his master in
skill. But Tom feared not an uphill game. He felt that he had the key to
the secret of his former defeats, and a third time, in 1758, challenged Taylor
to the field. Taylor had now retired, and, as already stated, kept the Fountain
at Deptford. The “old ’un” accepted the challenge without hesitation,
and in Hertfordshire, one mile and a half from St. Alban’s, on the 13th of
August, 1758, the heroes met, the stakes being 200 guineas and the door
money. Faulkner, it is said, with the odds of three to one against him,
risked all he possessed upon the event. Faulkner, knowing his man, determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to keep him to fighting. “He began the attack with astonishing
courage, amounting almost to ferocity. For several of the earlier rounds
Faulkner was either knocked down or thrown. About the fifteenth, Taylor
was blowing, but in a rally each put in a dozen hard blows before Faulkner
levelled his opponent. Taylor now began to shift, and several times fell without
a blow.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c009'><sup>[26]</sup></a> This created much disapprobation and confusion, but Faulkner
easily consented to proceed. Afterwards they set to more resolutely, if possible,
than before, when after a severe contest of one hour and a quarter, Taylor
acknowledged himself beaten. They were both carried off the ground, and
it was the general opinion that more skill and courage never was displayed
by any pugilist in this country. Taylor’s loss of an eye and a blow at the
close of the fight on the other were the aiding excuses of his defeat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the next year (1759) Tom Faulkner was in turn challenged by Joe
James. Joe came of a fighting family, and his brother Jack James, “the
bruiser at Broughton’s Amphitheatre,” with his father, “old Jockey James,
of Newmarket,” seconded young Joe. The battle came off at Putney,
Surrey, on April 8, 1759, for 100 guineas. “A stage was erected near the
White Lion Inn, and they set-to about two o’clock. Before a blow was
struck the odds were two to one (they betted preposterously tempting odds
in those green and early days) in favour of James, and after the third round
five to one. Joe knocked Faulkner down several times (here was piling
up the agony), when, in the last round, <em>which was not more than ten minutes
from the commencement of the contest</em>, Faulkner, by a well-aimed blow, brought
down James (!), on which, though apparently not hurt or even fatigued,
he gave in.” We should think so: it would have been mere tempting
fortune to go on. The chronicler adds, “the indignation of the spectators
was very highly expressed by their hissing him off the ground,”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c009'><sup>[27]</sup></a> which did
not, it seems, prevent the bets going with the battle-money. Verily, as
Bildad the Shuhite said of the man of Uz, so may we say of this ancient
ring-scribe, “Behold, he is yet in his greenness.” “Old Jockey James”
seems to have known when to give “the office” that the “book was
full.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom appears now to have betaken himself to attacking his opponents’
<em>stumps</em>, and bowling them out with “underhand twisters,” for as yet the
hand above the elbow was not, the curve-bladed bat was like a butter-knife,
and two stumps with a cross-piece gave every chance that a straight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>ball would go harmlessly through the wicket. Yet were there skill and
enjoyment in those days of our forefathers, and the village green and its
May-pole were institutions of “Merrie England.” The May-pole is as
extinct as the megatherium, and what has modern science given us in its
place? Among those who—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“At foot-ball or at cricket,</div>
      <div class='line'>At prison-base or touching-chase</div>
      <div class='line'>Right featly then could prick it,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Tom Faulkner was long remembered. Yet does his name again occur
in 1789. The bruisers of Birmingham challenged those of the best note in
London. Isaac Perrins challenged Tom Johnson, the champion (See life of
<span class='sc'>Johnson</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>.) Jacombs challenged Bryan (Big Ben); Pickard, George
Ingleston, the brewer; and these fights came off, as we shall see, in favour
of the metropolis. Fired with the idea, Tom <span class='sc'>Faulkner</span> (at 53 years of
age!) challenged Watson, and Thornhill threw down the gauntlet to Hooper,
the tinman. These two last matches went off; a proof, we think, that the
Birmingham backers were not without judgment, though they did lose the
first three events.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Faulkner was certainly an evergreen of amazing sap and pith. Early
in 1791 he was challenged by Thornhill (called in the report “the Warwickshire
bruiser”), who had been disappointed in his match with Hooper, the
tinman. The veteran Tom accepted the cartel, and they met at Studley, in
Warwickshire, March 21, 1791. “Ryan seconded Faulkner, and Williams
was his bottleholder. Jack Lea waited upon Thornhill, with Biggs his
bottleholder.” We copy the report. “At two o’clock the combatants set-to,
and throughout the battle Tom’s superiority in judgment and distance was
manifestly evident. Thornhill was much the stronger man, and only fell by
one knock-down blow during the contest, except the last, which Tom struck
him in the neck, too forcibly to be withstood, and Thornhill gave in. The
conflict was extremely severe, and lasted fifty minutes. The door money
amounted to upwards of £80, two-thirds of which became the property of
the winner, and the remainder to the unsuccessful combatant.” Faulkner
was one of those lucky men who closed a career of exceptional length with
the garland of victory on his grey head. Tom was living in 1798.</p>

  <h4 class='c016'>BILL DARTS (CHAMPION)—1764‒1771.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Among the boxers of his day, Bill Darts, the dyer, held a high reputation
for steady courage and hard hitting, and by no means a contemptible amount
of science. One of the most remarkable of his battles was with Tom
Juchau,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c009'><sup>[28]</sup></a> at Guildford, Surrey, in May, 1766. It was a famous fight for
forty minutes, when Juchau was beaten out of time. The stakes were
1,000 guineas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dogget, the West Country Bargeman, had secured so high a name among
the “twoads” that an invite was given to Bill Darts to come down to Marlborough
to be thrashed. With the first part of the invitation Bill complied;
the second he not only declined, but, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per contra</span></i>, gave Mr. Dogget such a
thrashing, that he carried off the honours of the day and the irate countryman’s
100 guineas staked upon the event.</p>

<p class='c007'>Swansey, the butcher, found friends to back him for 50 guineas, and he
and Darts met, Oct. 13, 1767, on Epping Forest. The butcher was soon
knocked down and thoroughly cut up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bill Darts now invited all comers for the championship, which he had held
for five years, when Lyons,<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c009'><sup>[29]</sup></a> a waterman of Kingston-upon-Thames, disputed
his title. They met, and Darts, for the first time, was defeated in forty-five
minutes, on the 27th of June, 1769.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bill Darts next entered the lists with a competitor of formidable name—Death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>(Stephen Oliver). Oliver was certainly “stale,” as he had been one
of Broughton’s favourite pupils. (See <span class='sc'>Death</span>.) It was a well-contested
fight, Oliver proving extremely game and skilful; but the superior strength
and weight of Darts’ hits overcame the darts of Death, and the namesake of
the universal conqueror fell before Bill’s victorious arm. This battle was
fought at Putney, on a stage, March 25th, 1770. “Boxiana” has not given
a single date to any of Darts’ fights; accordingly, “Fights for the Championship,”
1855, informs its readers that, “the dates of these battles,” as
well as those of George Meggs, Millsom, etc., “are not recorded!”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 18th of May, 1771, during Epsom races, Bill Darts fought Peter
Corcoran, an Irish bruiser of vast pretensions, about whom Pierce Egan has
indited his usual amount of rhodomontade, which we shall correct under his
name. The match was made for £100 aside, by the notorious black-leg and
bully, Captain O’Kelly, the lucky owner of Eclipse, who, “before the fight
gave Bill Darts 100 guineas to play <em>cross</em>.”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c009'><sup>[30]</sup></a> The rest of this nefarious
swindle we will give, according to our plan, under the notice of the so-called
victor Corcoran. Bill had now sold his reputation, and was a lost man;
his seducer, the greater scoundrel, fared, like woman’s seducer, none the
worse</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Through tattered clothes small vices do appear—</div>
      <div class='line'>Robes and furred gowns hide all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps one of the funniest pieces of historical perversion on record is
Pierce Egan’s account (without a date) of this scandalous affair. It would
be injustice to mutilate it. “The famous Bill Darts now mounted the stage
with Corcoran for £200, to give additional sport to Epsom races. The set-to
commenced with cautious sparring on the part of Darts, who soon discovered
that he could not win (!), and in a short time gave in. A singular report
crept into circulation, accounting for Darts losing the battle, that Colonel
O’Kelly (one of the most celebrated sportsmen on the turf) backed his countryman
to a large amount; but to make his bets dead sure, on the night
previous to the fight, he presented Darts with £100 not to win the battle,
but positively to lose it. Surely no thoroughbred sportsman could commit
so barefaced a robbery!” This is rather modest, considering the Colonel’s
character; what follows, however, distances it by lengths. “And upon the
best information, we are assured that Darts in his prime was never half man
enough for Peter Corcoran!” The notes of admiration are Pierce’s: we
have omitted his emphasised italics and small capitals. The reader may
form his own conclusion by reading Corcoran’s actual battles.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Darts appears several times as a second during 1771 and the following
years; notedly in a fight between Sam Peters, of Birmingham, and Rossemus
Gregory, an Irishman, in which Darts seconded the Hibernian, but behaved
so unfairly to save his man that Peters refused to fight on. The result will
be found under <span class='sc'>Peters</span>.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PETER CORCORAN</h4>

<p class='c013'>We may as well here dispatch Peter Corcoran, to whom Pierce Egan has
devoted several pages of fabrication in honour of “ould Ireland.” First he
thrashed all the potato diggers in the vicinity of his father’s mud edifice;
then he, and perhaps another, beat an English butcher who refused to let
him and a friend have a shoulder of mutton at their own price: Pierce
almost hints they had no money. It seems that Paddy not only thrashed
the butcher “Master Steel” in a few minutes, but “shortly afterwards enjoyed
his mutton (is the reader or the mutton roasted?) with as keen an appetite as
if nothing had happened (which we suppose was the case), and next day
pursued his journey to London.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c009'><sup>[31]</sup></a> At Portsmouth, after a trip to sea, he
performed a number of feats of strength; one among them was “<em>beating a
whole press gang</em>, and breaking the lieutenant’s sword over his head.” Here’s
a scene for a new “Black-eyed Susan.” The promotion of Billy Taylor’s
sweetheart did not, however, fall to the lot of Peter, and “on leaving the
navy, he came to London,” etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first authenticated notice of his name we find under the date of,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sept. 4th (1769). A boxing match was decided between Turner, a
pugilist who had beaten Bill Stevens, and Peter Corcoran, an Irishman, for
£20 aside, which was won by <em>the former</em>.” The battle took place in Hyde
Park, and is correctly given in “Fistiana,” though without a date. Now
let us turn to “Boxiana,” p. 59, vol. i. “Peter beat one Turner, who
fought him for £20, and although the latter had beaten the Nailer, yet, in
the hands of Corcoran, he was soon disposed of.” Three others, “good
men,” Dalton and Davis and “Smiler, the bricklayer,” were also, according
to the same veracious chronicler, “beaten dreadfully.” These exploits bring
us to Corcoran’s two “crosses” and his final thrashing. That with Bill
Darts we have said enough about. Of this we read in a contemporary print—“After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>a little sparring, Corcoran gave Darts a blow on the side of the
head, which drove him against the rail of the stage, when he immediately
gave in. It was said that Darts had played booty, and none of the sporting
men would afterwards back him; thus by one dirty action Darts lost all the
fame he had been for so many years acquiring.” This reflection has a peculiar
moral squint, as we have already said. “What about the Colonel who
bought the poor fellow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether his next battle with Peters was a victory we will just leave to
the reader of the report. “The long expected match between Sam Peters
and Peter Corcoran took place at Waltham Abbey, Essex, in June, 1774.
At setting-to the bets were three to one in favour of Peters (this, we should
say, was a good thing), who, though he maintained the superiority, gave in
without any apparent cause at the expiry of fifteen minutes, greatly to the
disappointment of the sporting ones.” We should think so. Here is the
account from “Boxiana,” p. 86, “Sam Peters was the best man, according
to Corcoran’s account, that ever set-to with him. It was a complete hammering
fight (!), and at the expiration of <em>ten minutes</em> Peters declared he was
satisfied, and Corcoran’s body for several days afterwards was entirely black,
the bruises being extremely severe.” Heavy work on both sides for <em>ten</em>
minutes. The fastest moderns cannot go this pace. The account of Corcoran’s
battle with Harry Sellers, October 16th, 1776, will be found under <span class='sc'>Harry
Sellers</span>. As Peter was thrashed, it was of course “a sell,” though it looks
like a victory on its merits, and “Boxiana” “points a moral,” which is
applicable to this as to all other cases of betrayal of backers by pugilists, who
should never forget—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis not in mortals to command success,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>but “do more, deserve it,” is very good—if the case warranted it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The favourable notice in “Pancratia,” whence Pierce drew the staple he
has spun out so absurdly, thus speaks of Corcoran: “Peter, as a pugilist of his
period, stands first rank as a fair fighter; being generally engaged with
powerful pugilists, he was <em>unfortunate</em> in the <em>events</em> of his contests, and indeed
he had little reason to triumph when victorious, for as he never shifted
or fell, unless accidentally, without a blow, he seldom escaped a severe
drubbing.” These are the words of truth and soberness, and place Corcoran’s
courage and game on a fair footing, despite the extravagant eulogies of his
compatriot. Perhaps, however, Mr. Vincent Dowling, in his “Fistiana,”
has exercised the wisest discretion; finding the accounts too discrepant for
reconciling, he has left the name of Corcoran out of the letter C altogether.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>HARRY SELLERS (CHAMPION)—1776‒1785.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Harry Sellers, a west country boxer of deserved provincial reputation,
was chosen by some friends as a likely young fellow to reduce the braggadocia
of Corcoran, whose challenges were of the true Hibernian cut of some
hedge-schoolmaster transplanted to the Seven Dials. The match was made
for 100 guineas “and a bet of £500 or £600 on the event,”—we do not
profess to know what the last phrase means—and the combatants met at the
Crown Inn, Staines, October 10, 1776. The attendance appears to have been
remarkably good. Corcoran, with the “gift of the gab,” was the landlord of
the Blakeney’s Head, St. Giles’s, and was a sort of “Stunning Joe Banks”
of his day: what he was good for as a pugilist we cannot say. “At the first
onset,” says the report, “Corcoran gave his antagonist a violent blow, which
threw him to the farthest end of the stage, and the odds increased from three
to four to one in Peter’s favour. Sellers now fought very shy for about eighteen
minutes, in order to wind his antagonist, which having accomplished, he
advanced boldly and beat him by straight-forward hitting in ten minutes.”
Did any one ever read a more “plain unvarnished tale” of how a natural
fighter and good boxer beat a bounceable publican? What need of the
farrago we find at pages 86, 87, 88, vol. i. of “Boxiana,” to explain that
which needs no explanation? Corcoran was thrashed, and, we believe,
couldn’t help it. Pierce tells us a story of his house in St. Giles’s flowing
with “all sorts of spirits, plenty of new pots, etc., inside and outside painted,
and got up in superior style to what it was ever witnessed before,” etc.
Moreover—and here is the detail that clinches it—“Peter was playing
skittles next morning with all the activity and cheerfulness of a man who
had never been engaged in pugilism.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Pierce about this period was a Dublin “gossoon,” he must have had an
exact knowledge of the decorations, interior and exterior, of Peter’s hostelrie,
and a reliable tradition of his morning’s amusements. For ourselves, a
much more careful search than that of the inventor of “Boxiana” (who
made none, by the way), fails to tell us more than we have hereinbefore set
down.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 4th of June, 1777, at Ascot Heath races, Joe Hood,<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c009'><sup>[32]</sup></a> a hardy and
successful boxer, fought Harry Sellers for 50 guineas aside. Joe fought with
great courage and skill, but the science and activity of Sellers secured the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>victory. Hood fought Sellers again, four weeks afterwards (June 2), and
was again beaten.</p>

<p class='c007'>In June, 1778, Harry Sellers met the once formidable champion, Bill
Stevens, the Nailer. It was a one-sided affair. Stevens, still courageous,
could not stand against the rapidity, skill, and freshness of Harry, and was
defeated. The stake was but £25, which shows how the mighty Stevens
had fallen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Crown, at Slough, a favourite rendezvous of the swell patrons of
pugilism, was the scene, on the 25th of September, 1780, of a boxing match
between Harry Sellers and Duggan Fearns, an Irish boatswain (called Jack
Fearns in “Boxiana”). The accounts read very like a cross, though we can
hardly say that there is clear evidence. “The battle lasted <em>one minute and a
half</em>, when victory was declared in favour of Duggan.” We are not told
<em>how</em> the event was brought about, but the reporter adds his own opinion:
“the amateurs were swindled to a large amount,” and certainly very
clumsily.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 7th of June (1785), we find that Harry Sellers contested a battle
with William Harvey, an Irishman, in the Ass Field, near Holywell Mount,
Grays Inn Road, “in which, notwithstanding he exerted himself to the
utmost, he was conquered by dint of the Irishman’s strength in twenty
minutes.” The reader will observe the date is the 7th of June. This may
give him sufficient insight to value accordingly the story of “St. Patrick’s
evening” (17th March), the “insult to Mr. Harvey’s shamrock in his hat,”
the “leg of mutton and trimmings,” offered by Sellers to be let off a
thrashing, and the wretched rubbish in “Boxiana,” pp. 88, 89, “for the
greater glory of ould Ireland.” The red hot ire of Mr. Harvey remained
to cool from March 17th to the 7th of the following June, if there be any
truth in the periodical contemporary press.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appearance of Humphries, Big Ben (Brain), and the rise of the great
Tom Johnson, seem to have quite extinguished the minor pugilistic stars, and
so occupied the whole attention of the patrons and historians of the ring, that
Sellers disappears from the scene. In “Pancratia,” p. 63, we read, “It has
been reported that Sellers actually died with grief, on account of his friends
refusing to match him with the celebrated pugilist Tom Johnson when first
he rose into fame.” This proves, at any rate, that Sellers was what the
west countrymen call “a good woolled one:” there was no deficiency in
breed, whatever there might be in his probity or judgment.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>STEPHEN OLIVER (NICKNAMED DEATH).—1770‒1788.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Of</span> Stephen Oliver, whose singular sobriquet, “Death,” had a less
terrible derivation than it might suggest, we have but scant contemporary
notices, yet these have been neglected, and “Boxiana” dismisses him with
an incidental mention in the notice under <span class='sc'>Darts</span> (see p. 45, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>), and four
lines in reference to his battle with Small. Oliver seems, by general consent
of the best judges, to have been a remarkably skilful, steady, and formidable
boxer. The deadly paleness of his visage during his pugilistic contests procured
him the nickname of “Death.” Oliver, as one of Broughton’s pupils,
stood high on the list of his favourites. The veteran often commended him
as the best teacher and exponent of his system. “He was a well made man,
and light (as they reckoned it then), never exceeding twelve stone; he did
not possess great strength, but this he fully compensated by his astonishing
agility. Oliver fought more battles than any man in England, and though
frequently overmatched, often conquered against odds. But his sparring,”
adds the author of “Historical Sketches,”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c009'><sup>[33]</sup></a> “notwithstanding it was thought
excellent some years back, is now equalled by any pupil of Mendoza and
Humphries. This indisputably shows we moderns have improved in science.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We pass over a long interval of Stephen Oliver’s performances to come
to his great fight with Bill Darts, March 25, 1770, wherein he was defeated
by youth, length, weight, and strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>Six years afterwards, July 3rd, 1776, Death fought a short battle at
Barnet for £20 with a butcher of the name of William Small, a name by no
means corresponding with his bulk. A diurnal print tried a small piece of
wit in the form of what it called “an epigram.” Here it is—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ah! foolish wight, why strive to conquer Death?</div>
      <div class='line'>When he, thou know’st, can stop thy vital breath;</div>
      <div class='line'>That ruthless tyrant rules the lives of all,</div>
      <div class='line'>And vanquishes the Great, as well as <span class='sc'>Small</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The renowned Tom Johnson, of whom anon, had already beaten several
commoners, and especially Jarvis, “the fighting carman.” Stephen accepted
his general challenge, and, though stale and old, made a creditable fight, at
Blackheath, in 1784. (See <span class='sc'>Johnson</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>.) Though Jack Towers (brother
of William, the bricklayer) is called the “conqueror of the celebrated
<span class='sc'>Death</span>,” we cannot find the record of his victory.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Oliver still lingered on the stage till 1788, in which year, on April 17th,
“he fought one Elisha Crabbe,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c009'><sup>[34]</sup></a> a Jew, <em>on the turf</em>, at Blackheath.” It was
observed in the course of the contest that Death had the lead in fair boxing,
but that Crabbe got the best in closing, when he was generally successful in
flinging his adversary so as to pitch him on his head. Although Crabbe had
received many sharp blows, they did not impair his strength, but Death was
wounded badly in the face by a fall, and had a severe gash over his right
eyebrow. This obstructed his sight, and very much contributed to lose him
the battle. At the end of thirty-five minutes Crabbe succeeded in giving
Death a knock-down blow, and the Jew was declared the conqueror.
(“Pancratia,” p. 78.) The Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV.),
Colonel Hanger (Lord Coleraine), and the leading patrons of the ring, were
present on this occasion. A bye-battle between Doyle, a well known pugilist,
and a sawyer from Deptford, which followed, ended in the anonymous
sawyer beating the professional in twenty minutes.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>SAM PETERS, OF BIRMINGHAM—1771‒1774.</h4>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sam Peters</span>, of Birmingham, is one of the second rates demanding notice
previous to closing this chapter. After many victories in Warwickshire and
the midland counties, Sam made his way to the metropolis, and was backed
for £20 against Trainer, a stalwart Irish chairman. They met at Epping
Forest, June 7, 1771, but Sam was so overmatched that, after a clever fight
of thirty-seven minutes, he fell before the heavier metal of his antagonist.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next month, on the 13th of July, Sam entered the ring at Fair Mead
Bottom, near Epping, with Rossemus Gregory, another Hibernian pugilist.
Bill Darts seconded Gregory, and Peters gave in on the ground of Darts
interfering unfairly in favour of his man. Another match was accordingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>made, and came off in the Riding School at the Three Hats, Islington.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c009'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
Here Master Gregory found he had better not have “bitten his thumb” at
Sam, for he got a most undeniable thrashing in half an hour. Sam Peters’
“sell” with Corcoran, in 1774, has been already commented on. From this
time he ceased to find backers.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>JOE HOOD—1773‒1780.</h4>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Joe Hood</span>, a weaver, fought some good battles between 1773 and 1780.
His first important contest was with the noted Jem Parrot, on the 9th of
November, 1773, in White Conduit Fields, Islington, for a stake of 20
guineas. Rossemus Gregory (see <span class='sc'>Sam Peters</span>, of Birmingham, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>) seconded
Parrot, and Sam Peters attended upon Joe Hood. The fight was obstinately
contested for thirty-five minutes, when a dispute arose between the seconds
as to a foul blow. Rossy Gregory would not allow his man to fight longer,
and Parrot left the ground, refusing to return. The battle, upon a reference,
was awarded to Hood.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 31st of March, 1775, Joe Hood met and conquered Dennis Kellyhorn,
“a famous Irish bruiser.” The battle was for 50 guineas, and took
place at Chingford Hatch, Essex.</p>

<p class='c007'>Macdonald, a sawyer, of great strength and stature, issued a challenge to
Joe for £10. The set-to is described by the reporter as “furious on the part
of Macdonald.” Joe fought on the defensive for half an hour, when the rush
of Macdonald having slackened, Joe completely turned the tables, and milled
the sawyer all over the ring. Macdonald fought obstinately: “he was
beaten so dreadfully before he gave in, that both eyes were closed, and it was
found that his jaw was broken.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe’s next battle with the champion, Harry Sellers, June 4, 1777, ended
in a defeat, though “Hood displayed astonishing judgment and bottom.”
This important battle is not mentioned in “Boxiana” (<span class='sc'>Joe Hood</span>, p. 81), nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>in “Fistiana,” under <span class='sc'>Hood</span> (p. 58, edit. 1864); nor does Hood’s second
defeat (July 2, 1774) appear under his name in either authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>A noted Birmingham pugilist (the “Hardware Village” has always been
renowned for boxers) hight Joe Higgins, “who had fought fifteen battles, in
all of which he had been the conqueror,”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c009'><sup>[36]</sup></a> challenged Hood. He had miscalculated
his skill. They met July 23, 1778, when Hood gave him so severe
a beating as, says the authority just quoted, “taught him the proper respect
due to a scientific pugilist.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tide of battle now turned against Hood. On the 8th of September,
1778, after a severe attack of illness, Joe met “the Bristol Boy,” Peter Bath,
at Maidenhead races, for £50 a-side. “The bets were two to one in Joe’s
favour, notwithstanding his indifferent health.” Joe soon “found himself
entirely unable to cope with his opponent, and gave in after fighting twenty
minutes, when Bath<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c009'><sup>[37]</sup></a> was hailed the conqueror.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 4th of September, 1779, Hood was again unsuccessful in a pitched
battle in Smithfield with William Day, an active and game pugilist. This
seems to have been Joe’s last appearance as a principal, his constitution
being impaired.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER V.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>TOM JOHNSON (THOMAS JACKLING). CHAMPION OF ENGLAND—1783‒1791.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Tom Johnson, whose real name was Jackling, was a native of Derby,
although a general claim of Yorkshire extraction has been made for him, and
“Boxiana” so states it; followed, of course, by “Fights for the Championship,”
London, 1855. However, as he signs himself “Thomas Jackling, of
Derby,” in a printed letter, the point is not worth disputing. He surely
could himself have no motive for such a misrepresentation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Johnson, for we shall retain his popular name, was certainly a hero among
heroes; and if Tom was inferior to Broughton in science, he came certainly
nearest of any man that had hitherto appeared to that phœnix of pugilistic
skill. Nature had endowed him with unusual strength of body, and he was
universally admitted to possess a careful and precise style of hitting. His
courage was of the highest order, and he possessed a constitutional coolness
of disposition and temper. Johnson was born in 1750, the very year that
Jack Slack defeated his prototype, the champion Broughton, and at an early
age repaired to London, where he followed the laborious occupation of a corn-porter,
on a wharf near Old Swan Stairs. His surprising strength was paralleled
by his kindness of heart; and while in this employment an anecdote is
recorded of him which deserves preservation. Johnson’s fellow porter was
taken ill, and being burdened with a wife and a numerous family, dependent
on his labour for support, they were likely to be reduced to want, had not
Johnson immediately undertaken (unknown to them) to do his fellow porter’s
work, as well as his own. The warehouses where the corn was deposited
were situated at some distance from the wharf, at the end of a court, denominated,
from its steepness, “Labour-in-vain Court,” and to which place Tom
carried every journey two sacks of corn instead of one, and gave the money
to his family, till his fellow porter was able to return to his work. We
would recommend this anecdote for extract in the next number of the
“Evangelical Magazine;” it can be much better authenticated than most of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the “lose-nothing” benevolences of their portrait-loving “labourers in the
vineyard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As we prefer truth unadorned to clumsy rhetoric we have here merely
paraphrased what we find in contemporaries, and, where advisable, resorted to
acknowledged quotations. “After he (Johnson) had assumed the profession
of the gymnasium (somewhat pedantic this, but the writer as he goes on
becomes more natural), he soon proved the most effective among the whole
race of modern athletæ. His strength, science, and astonishing bottom gave
him rank superior to all his contemporaries, but his greatest excellence was
his surprising coolness and judgment. It may appear somewhat ridiculous
to the inconsiderate, and those prejudiced against the art, to attempt panegyric
upon the mental gifts of a pugilist, but where such a merit did or does
exist, it is a duty incumbent on those who are just and impartial to record it.
The natural powers of Johnson’s mind, although not developed by the care of
what the schoolmaster calls fostering education, were remarkably extensive
and capable of the accomplishment of great difficulties. Unlike many pugilists,
who seldom form any rules for their guidance in emergencies until they
find themselves on the stage, he invariably, long before, determined on a
system of conduct adapted to his own advantage, and calculated to defeat the
style of his adversary. To effect this, he calmly balanced the respective
abilities of his opponents, their tempers, power, and mode of attack, and particularly
noted the constitution and disposition of his opponent. His grand
principle in fighting was never unnecessarily to expose himself to danger,
nor hazard anything which could be obtained with certainty by waiting. By
acting on this plan, he frequently at the conclusion of a battle, was nearly in
as good condition as at its commencement; for though confident when first
setting-to of an easy conquest, his prudence led him to protract an engagement,
which perhaps he could not speedily terminate, unless by endangering
himself. He usually, therefore, acted on the defensive, and never made a
blow but when confident of getting home. If his opponent was cool, he was
cooler; if warm and precipitate, he endeavoured to make him still more so,
by using every justifiable measure to disappoint and baffle him; but he never
took advantage of his man by unfair manœuvres.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c009'><sup>[38]</sup></a> This description, despite
a certain stiffness of the old school, is written by a master, and an appreciator
of the art.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few casual turns-up had shown the bent of Johnson’s natural genius for
fistic fame; and at 23 years of age, in June, 1783, he met a carman of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>name of Jarvis in Lock’s Fields, Walworth. The skill of Johnson, a supposed
novice opposed to a practised boxer, astonished the spectators. Jarvis
was severely thrashed, and Tom’s fame spread abroad.</p>

<p class='c007'>A desperate rough, known as “the Croydon Drover,” next challenged
Johnson, and they fought on Kennington Common, in March, 1784. The
Drover was completely polished off in twenty-seven minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stephen Oliver (Death), though a decided “ould ’un,” would not believe in
Johnson’s vast superiority until he tried him, on Blackheath, in June, 1784,
when he had ocular demonstration by being beaten blind in thirty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Johnson now seems to have reposed on his laurels without a competitor
till 1786. On the 11th of January in that year, Bill Love,<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c009'><sup>[39]</sup></a> a butcher,
fancied Tom for 50 guineas a-side. Johnson disposed of Bill Love’s pretensions
in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jack Towers, “the celebrated conqueror of Death,” says the reporter,
though we have not met with the record, met Johnson (for a stake not
stated), at Barnet, in February, 1786, and was soundly beaten without a
chance of retrieving his fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this period, 1786, Humphries, Martin, the Bath butcher, and Mendoza
appeared. These celebrated men will be found duly chronicled “in
their right place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Fry, a big, heavy, and powerful man, next challenged Johnson for 50
guineas, and they fought at Kingston, in June, 1786, but in less than half
an hour Fry got so much broiled as to be very glad to put an end to the contest;
and Tom walked off the ground almost without a scratch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Johnson, about this period (1787) beat every one that was opposed to him,
and the sporting world was almost nonplussed to find a man who might stand
something like a chance with him. As the metropolis could produce no such
character, Bristol was searched (the <em>parsley-bed</em> of pugilists), when Bill
Warr<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c009'><sup>[40]</sup></a> was selected as an article that could be depended upon. He was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>backed to fight Johnson for 200 guineas, on a stage, at Oakingham, in Berkshire,
on January 18, 1787.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first round Warr found out he had got a trump to deal with, by
receiving a doubler from Johnson. He immediately assumed the defensive.
In fact, it was scarcely worthy of being called a fight, and the amateurs were
not only disappointed but much displeased. Warr was convinced that he
could not beat Johnson by standing up to him, and therefore determined to
try whether he could not tire him out by shifting and falling; accordingly,
whenever Tom seemed likely to make a blow, Bill Warr was on his knees
praying for pluck, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i> Tass Parker and Nick Ward of more modern days.
This humbugging lasted for nearly an hour and a half, Johnson’s intentions
being continually frustrated by Warr’s dropping. At length an ugly hit
nailed him as he was falling. He insisted on a “foul!” which not being
admitted, he instantly bolted, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his
seconds to come back and finish the fight. In the words of the report:
“Warr jumped up from his knees, crying ‘foul!’ and jumped from the stage.
His second called him several times to return, but he ‘mizzled’ clean off.”
Johnson was now firmly established as the champion; his fame ran before
him, and it was some months before any person could be found hardy enough
to dispute his well-earned title; at length, a brave Hibernian chief, who,
like Tom Johnson, had milled all his opponents, came forward, and soon
found backers.</p>

<p class='c007'>How this came about must be told by an episode. On November 22,
1787, a severe contest was decided, in Stepney Fields, between W. Savage
and Doyle. Tom Johnson seconded Savage, and Ryan, his countryman
Doyle. After a sharp battle of forty-five minutes, Doyle was defeated, and
Ryan in some heat challenged Johnson.</p>

<p class='c007'>Michael Ryan, the Irish champion’s skill and courage stood so high,
that the odds were six to four before the fight, which took place at Wradisbury,
in Buckinghamshire, on December 19, 1787, for 300 guineas a-side.
The seconds were chosen from the first-rate pugilists, Humphries for Johnson,
and Dunn for Ryan; and even the bottle-holders were of fistic eminence,
being Tom Tring for the latter, and Mendoza for the former. The spectators
were numerous. The celebrated Mr. Windham, Sir Richard Symonds,
Colonel Hanger, Colonel Hamilton, Mr. Bradyl, General Fitzpatrick, etc.,
were more than spectators on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contest long hung doubtful, though, at the commencement, the odds
were in favour of Ryan. What follows is from “Boxiana.” “After the
fight had continued nearly twenty minutes, and at the close of a most tremendous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>round, Ryan put in a blow upon Johnson’s temple, which so completely
stunned him that his arms fell by his side, and was following up this
advantage with another hit, which must have decided the contest, when
Humphries ran in to save Johnson, and caught Ryan in his arms. Cries of
‘Foul! foul!’ resounded from all parts, and the friends of Ryan instantly
demanded the money, by observing that, as long as Johnson had not fallen,
it was perfectly fair on the part of Ryan to strike him, and that the latter
had won the battle. Here a general clamour took place, during which Ryan,
with the warmth peculiar to his country, indignantly told his second, Dunn,
that he had not done his duty by him as a man, in suffering such conduct to
take place without resenting it, and, had he not been prevented, he would
have milled Dunn upon the spot, his rage was so great. Considerable time
having now elapsed, Johnson was recovered, and challenged Ryan to renew
the combat: the latter, like a man, notwithstanding it was considered there
was no necessity for so doing, agreed to it, thinking he could beat Johnson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The battle was at length renewed; but it was soon perceived that
Ryan’s strength was exhausted by passion, and he now, in about ten
minutes, became an easy conquest to Johnson, by giving away the chance.
Ryan’s conduct in the battle was so noble, and his manly courage and science
so truly apparent, that the amateurs were still left in doubt to decide accurately
which was the best man” (“Boxiana,” pp. 94, 95).</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of this opinion, a second battle was determined upon, and
fought upon a stage in the Rabbit Dell in Cashiobury Park, near Rickmansworth,
in Hertfordshire, for 300 guineas a-side, on February 11, 1789. This
was a contest of great anxiety, and the whole sporting world was there, from
the Corinthian to the costermonger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Johnson, who had for his second, Humphries, and Jackson as his bottleholder,
mounted the stage at three o’clock, and were immediately followed
by Ryan, who was seconded by Mr. Rolfe, a baker, and Nowlan his bottleholder.
The set-to was one of the finest ever witnessed, and much science
was displayed; the parries and feints eliciting general admiration. At length
Ryan put in a severe blow on Johnson’s chest, which floored him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second round, which continued about two minutes, was terrible beyond
description—science seemed forgotten—when Ryan received a knock-down
blow. The battle was well sustained on both sides for some time; but
Ryan’s passion getting the better of him, he began to lose ground. “Johnson,”
says “Pancratia,” p. 83, “stopped Ryan’s blows with the greatest
dexterity, and, hitting over his guard, cut him under the eyes.” Ryan’s
head and eyes made a dreadful appearance. The contest lasted for thirty-three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>minutes, when Ryan gave in. A hat, ornamented with blue ribbons
was placed upon the conqueror’s head; and Johnson gained a considerable
sum of money, as, besides the 300 guineas stakes, and £512 door money,
equally divided between the combatants, Mr. Hollingsworth, a cornfactor,
and a former master of Johnson, settled £20 a year upon him for life, in
consideration of the money he had won by backing him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brain, better known as Big Ben (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>), was now considered the only
man capable of meeting Johnson, and a match was made for £1,000; but
Ben, being taken ill at the appointed time, forfeited the deposit, which
was £100.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now approach one of the most interesting and remarkable contests in
the annals of pugilism. The various coloured accounts of more modern
writers cannot be excused of exaggerating the incidents of this fight, yet, as
our object is rather authenticity than “sensation,” we shall simply transcribe
the report from the old <cite>Sporting Magazine</cite>, for the month of September,
1789.</p>

<p class='c007'>Birmingham having challenged London to produce its most noted men to
meet their best pugilists, the matter has been put in train, and the combatants
paired thus:—Isaac Perrins<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c009'><sup>[41]</sup></a> challenges Tom Johnson, the champion;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Jacombs will fight Bryan (Big Ben); Pickard, George Ingleston (the brewer);
Tom Faulkner (the cricketer), Watson; and Thornhill, Hooper (the tinman).
The challenges of the three first heroes were accepted, and the terms proposed
by “the bruisers” agreed to.</p>

<p class='c007'>The meeting of Johnson and Perrins was arranged for the first October
meeting at Newmarket, to be fought on the turf, for 250 guineas a-side, and
two-thirds of the door money to the winner, one-third to the defeated combatant.
We continue from the contemporary report:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perrins was an uncommonly strong man, gigantic in height and weight,
with force adapted to his form, and, for his size, of astonishing activity. He
stood six feet two inches in his stocking feet, and weighed seventeen stone,
three stone heavier than Johnson. Perrins is stated to have lifted eight
hundred weight of iron into a waggon, and to have performed other feats of
strength almost beyond credibility. He was universally allowed to possess
much skill in boxing, and excellent bottom. He had won many battles with
ease, beating every competitor in Warwickshire, Staffordshire, and Worcestershire,
and undoubtedly thought himself superior to every athlete, as is shown
by his advertisement, challenging to fight any man in England for 500
guineas. His Birmingham friends considered him invincible, and backed
him in the contest for many thousands of pounds, at two, and even three, to
one against Johnson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The combatants, however, were not permitted to fight at Newmarket,
and Banbury, in Oxfordshire, was then fixed upon, where they accordingly
met on the 22nd of October, 1789. The battle was fought on a turfed stage,
raised five feet from the ground, twenty-four feet square, and railed in.
Johnson’s second was Will Ward (Warr), and his bottle-holder Joe Ward;
Pickard seconded Perrins, and his brother was his bottle-holder. Colonel
Tarleton was umpire for Johnson, and Mr. Meadows, of Birmingham, for
Perrins.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At a little before one the combatants set-to, and Johnson’s friends, who
before had flattered themselves with certain success, when they viewed the
wonderful difference of size between the bruisers, began to tremble for
the event.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For five minutes all was anxious expectation; Perrins then with great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>force aimed a blow, which Johnson very dexterously eluded, and gave the
first blow, by which Perrins fell. The three next rounds terminated also in
Johnson’s favour, who confused his antagonist by dancing round him, and
occasionally planting an unexpected hit. Perrins became excessively irritated
at this conduct, and throwing off the caution he had shown at the
beginning, followed Johnson with vast resolution, and appearing to treat his
manœuvres with contempt, he, despite of several sharp hits, at last got in a
successful knock-down blow, which success he followed up for several rounds,
in one of which he brought blood by a severe cut on Johnson’s lip.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Johnson watched his opportunity, and in reply to a taunt from the Birmingham
Goliath jumped in, and planting a blow over Perrins’ left eye, cut
the eyebrow, and completely closed it up. This blow, and the failure of
Perrins’ wind, which was now very visible, raised the bets amazingly in
Johnson’s favour; the odds, however, again changed upon Perrins closing one
of Johnson’s eyes; after this Johnson began once more to fight cunning, and
having skilfully parried a violent attack of Perrins, he caught him so severe
and swift a blow in the face as laid his nose completely open. Odds now
rose 100 to 10 on Johnson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perrins recovered his breath, and with great vigour and resolution
attacked Johnson, who retreated parrying, but Perrins got in a blow over
Johnson’s right eye that again brought down the odds, but not to even.
Forty rounds of resolute boxing had now taken place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the following round Johnson fell when not struck, and Perrins
claimed the victory, but the umpires decided it was allowable,<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c009'><sup>[42]</sup></a> as the articles
did not specify to the contrary.” We suspect the Birmingham men, for
Perrins was as brave a boxer as ever pulled off a shirt, were trying to
“snatch a verdict,” as the day was clearly going against them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perrins, in turn, seemed now to lose much of his strength. He tried to
imitate his antagonist’s mode of fighting, with which he was totally unacquainted.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c009'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
He fought low, and had recourse to chopping back-handed
strokes, which at first drove back Johnson and disconcerted him, but against
which he soon guarded himself very collectedly; often getting home a sharp
return.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Johnson seemed to improve in strength as the battle went on, never
beginning the attack. Perrins, in aiming several heavy blows, fell, as if
from weakness. Johnson watched his falling, and hit him in the face,
generally falling at the same time. He seemed now to hit Perrins whenever
he tried. At the end of one hour and a quarter Johnson gathered himself for
a blow, and it took effect directly, in the centre of the face,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c009'><sup>[44]</sup></a> and finished as
severe a contest as stands recorded in the annals of pugilism; the combatants
having fought sixty-two rounds of fair hard boxing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Bullock won £20,000 by the battle. He backed Johnson, taking high
odds, and afterwards made him a present of £1000 (and he deserved the
generous gift). The door-money amounted to £800, of which Johnson had
£533, after expenses deducted. As the song says,</p>

<p class='c007'>The remarkable print from which our engraving is furnished, is certainly,
when we compare it with most of the art-productions of the day, a most
creditable production. The descriptions which we have quoted from witnesses
of the fight, and from persons who well knew the combatants, are fully
realised. Although the stoop of Johnson certainly exaggerated the vast
proportion of Perrins, the disparity, upon closer examination, is not so
extreme. The faces, you feel, must be portraits.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fights which followed will be found under <span class='sc'>Brain</span> (Big Ben) and
<span class='sc'>George Ingleston</span> (note to <span class='sc'>John Jackson</span>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Johnson now seemed to be without a rival to dispute his supremacy; but
about the year 1790, the Duke of Hamilton, who had been the firm friend
and patron of Ben Brain of Bristol (Big Ben), was extremely anxious to back
his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i> against the renowned, and as yet invincible Johnson. A challenge
was accordingly published, the Duke backing Ben for 500 guineas.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Johnson,” says “Pancratia,” “who the year before possessed the amount
of £5000 acquired by his astonishing success in the battles he had fought, by
an unlucky ‘<em>leter</em>’ of shaking the elbow, found himself obliged, in order to
replenish the exchequer, to accept Ben’s offer. The conditions were agreed
upon, and the day fixed for January 17th, 1791. Never was public curiosity
more on tiptoe;” but as this battle belongs by our system to the memoir of
the victor, it will be found in the memoir of <span class='sc'>Big Ben</span>. This was the last
fight of both these celebrated pugilists.</p>

<p class='c007'>Johnson’s name appears from time to time as second to Hooper, the tinman,
“Gentleman Jackson,” and other pugilists, but no more as principal. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>find Bell soon after his victory over Stanyard, the Birmingham boxer, (in
December 1792) challenging Johnson to “mill for a guinea;” whereon the
reporter remarks: “Tom, however, has lost too many of the yellow-boys
lately to trouble himself to win a single one, and left the stage.” A sufficient
allusion to Tom’s improvidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Johnson, becoming a Boniface, took the “Grapes” in Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields.
Here he failed in business, owing to his gambling propensities, which also
caused the loss of his license. He then became the proprietor of an EO table
at races, etc. This, too, failing, he migrated to Ireland. In Dublin he kept,
as we see by advertisements, a public house in Cooper-Alley: but here again
the gaming practices and frequenters incensed the magistrates, and he was
deprived of his license. He next is found in Cork, where he advertised for
pupils in the art of boxing, and where, on the 21st of January, 1797, aged
forty-seven years, the Champion fell before the arm of the great leveller—death.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Johnson’s appearance,” says a contemporary, “indicated, when stripped,
more of strength than beauty of form. He was in height nearly five feet nine
inches, and about fourteen stone in weight; a remarkably round-made man,
with very fine chest and shoulders, and displaying immensely strong loins.
He was by no means a showy fighter, and his guard was generally considered
inelegant, and his attitudes more defensive than otherwise. In the fight he
was peculiarly steady, watching every movement of his antagonist with a
coolness unequalled, receiving the attack unappalled, and scarcely ever failing
in the return of planting a most desperate hit. The head was his favourite
object, and if his adversary did not possess considerable science, he was in
extreme danger of being put in the dark. Johnson walked round his antagonist
in a way peculiar to himself, that so puzzled his adversary to find out
his intent, that he was frequently thrown off his guard, by which manœuvring
Johnson often gained the most important advantages. Tom was thorough
game, and showed the utmost contempt for retreating; at the same time
careful to avoid exposing his person too much to the attacks of his antagonist.
One pugilist,” continues the author of “Pancratia,” “may be superior in
strength, a second in science, a third in endurance, but in Johnson have been
more fully combined the requisites of a complete boxer than in any pugilist
up to this day.”</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>BENJAMIN BRAIN (BIG BEN). CHAMPION—1786‒1791.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Benjamin Brain (called in the chronologies Brian and Bryan) was a
native of Bristol, where he was born in the year 1753. His familiar nickname,
“Big Ben,” was scarcely justified by his size, his weight being rather
under that of Johnson (14 stone), and his height 5 feet 10 inches. Brain
was a powerful pugilist, celebrated for his straight and severe right-handed
deliveries, though remarkably good with both hands. Ben’s early years were
passed as a collier at Kingswood, near his native place; and it was here that
the future champion first signalised himself by a battle with Clayton, “the
Shropshire champion.” A fellow collier, also of Kingswood, called
Bob Harris, who had earned a provincial reputation in that nursery for
pugilists, Bristol, also succumbed to Ben, after a game and determined
conquest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brain arrived in London in 1774, shortly after these battles, and passed
several years as a coal-porter, at a wharf in the Strand. He was a good-looking
man, and when out of his business always appeared clean and
respectable, mild and sociable in his demeanour, and never ridiculously
presuming upon his qualities as a boxer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ben’s first set-to in London was with “the Fighting Grenadier,” in the
Long Fields, Bloomsbury, on October 31, 1786, in which, had it not been
for the assistance of a medical man, who witnessed the contest, Ben must
have been defeated. The soldier was a first-rate punisher, and Ben’s eyes
were so swelled, from the heavy blows he received, that he could not see,
when just at this juncture the ring was broken, during which accident the
swellings were skilfully lanced by a surgeon, and Ben restored to vision. A
fresh ring was made, and the combat renewed; and in the course of a few
minutes the Grenadier gave in.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Corbally, an Irish chairman, fought Ben, upon a stage, twenty-five feet
square, at Navestock in Essex, on December 31, 1788, after Bill Warr
had defeated Wood, the coachman. Notwithstanding the weather was
extremely severe, the combatants stripped with the most perfect indifference,
and the fight was carried on with determined courage on both sides;
Corbally was eventually defeated. Mr. John Jackson seconded Ben on this
occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1789 he forfeited £100 to Johnson, as already noticed, which sum was
deposited in part of £500, Brain being in a bad state of health.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ben received a challenge from Jacombs, a Birmingham pugilist, which he
accepted (See <span class='sc'>Johnson</span> and <span class='sc'>Perrins</span>), and the battle came off at Banbury, in
Oxfordshire, on a twenty-four feet square stage, October 23, 1789. Jacombs<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c009'><sup>[45]</sup></a>
was a stout made man, of high courage, and not without science. In the
early part of the combat, Jacombs exhibited determined resolution, and went
into Brain in a style that would take no denial. Whether Ben felt any doubt
about the battle, he did not conduct himself after his accustomed method, but
fought on the retreat, shifting often to avoid Jacombs’ blows, and fell frequently.
Jacombs, on the contrary, received Ben’s attacks undauntedly.
Considerable disapprobation was expressed by the spectators, particularly the
Warwickshire men, who were getting outrageous at Ben’s manœuvring.
Brain at length stood to his adversary, and showed what he was capable of
performing by putting in a tremendous floorer, which quickly convinced the
spectators of his<a id='t66'></a> quality. First-rate courage was displayed upon both sides;
but after a most dreadful battle of one hour and twenty-six minutes, the
brave Jacombs was conquered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Tring (the Big Porter at Carlton House) was matched, as a sort of
bye-battle, with Ben, who, as we gather from contemporary prints, had so
very “little” opinion of his really “big” opponent’s boxing qualifications,
that he met him at Dartford, for the paltry stake of 10 guineas a-side.
Pierce Egan has invented a dreadful battle, in which “Ben was nearly
blind,” “the blows that passed between them were tremendous in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>extreme,” and that Big Ben “refused to enter the lists with Tom Tring a
second time, but declared before his death that his constitution had suffered
most materially from the severe blows which he had encountered at Dartford,”
etc. (see “Boxiana,” vol i., pp. 298, 299, <span class='sc'>Tom Tring</span>). The fact is,
Tom could not hit his man, and was thoroughly beaten in twelve rounds,
occupying under twenty minutes.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c009'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the following year (1790), the battle, long anxiously looked for
between Big Ben and Hooper, the tinman (see <span class='sc'>Hooper’s</span> other battles in
Period II.) at Chapel Row Revel, near Newbury, Berkshire, on August 30,
for 100 guineas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hooper’s patron had completely miscalculated his man’s powers. The
affair could not be called a fight. Ben treated his opponent with perfect
contempt. In a close at the end of the first round Ben hit Hooper so heavily
in the body, that he could not be induced again to come within distance.
He fell every time Ben’s hand reached him, and even before; ran all over the
stage, filled his mouth with water and spirted it in Ben’s face, accompanied
by provoking and blackguard epithets to irritate Ben and throw him off his
guard. It is true Hooper got in some few “facers” by his trickery and
activity, and he was on the ground before Ben could get in a return. At
length Ben determined not to follow him, and none of the stratagems of the
tinman could induce him to break ground. He stood firmly at the scratch,
in the middle of the stage, and called upon Hooper to face him: this the
latter did for a few seconds, and was then off and away. This piece of diversion
took place on August 30, 1790, at Chapel Row Revel, near Newbury, in
Berkshire, and continued for three hours and a half. The night coming on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>fast, several of the amateurs asked Ben if he should be able to finish the
battle that day? He jocularly replied, “That it entirely depended upon his
antagonist;” and observed, “they had better begin the next morning at six
o’clock, and have the whole day before them.” The Fancy were completely
disgusted with such treatment. After what was termed one hundred and
eighty rounds had taken place, and it being nearly dark, it was declared
a drawn battle, and Ben walked off without receiving any particular
hurt.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c009'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>And now came Ben’s crowning victory over the renowned, brave, and
skilful, but imprudent and reckless champion, Tom Johnson.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards the close of the year 1790, the Duke of Hamilton, the patron and
firm supporter of Ben Brain in all his matches, was anxious to match him
against the hitherto invincible Johnson, and offered to back his man for
500 guineas. We have already noticed Tom’s reckless prodigality and
gambling, and necessity spurred him not to let pass the chance of such a
golden prize. “Public expectation,” says the <cite>Oracle</cite> newspaper, “never
was raised so high by any pugilistic contest; great bets were laid, and
it is estimated £20,000 was wagered on this occasion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On a stage twenty feet square,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c009'><sup>[48]</sup></a> at Wrotham, in Kent, on January the
17th, 1791, the two best boxers in England met to decide the Championship.
Punctually at one o’clock, the time named in the articles, Johnson
ascended the theatre of combat, followed by Joe Ward, as second, and Dan
Munday as his bottle-holder. He bore an aspect of steady composure and
modest confidence. Big Ben immediately followed, with a cheerful countenance,
having Will Warr as his second,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c009'><sup>[49]</sup></a> and Humphries as his bottle-holder.
“The betting, from the first making of the match,” says the reporter, “was
seven to four in favour of Johnson.” Truly our grandfathers were bold, nay
reckless, layers of odds. What follows is a verbatim transcript of the contemporary
report.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The combatants being prepared, set to, and in the first round, which
was much more violent and quickly terminated than usual, Johnson
fell upon his forehead, from a violent blow on the nose. This blow determined
the fate of the battle, for Johnson never was capable of recovering
himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the second round he also fell by a severe blow; bets became
even.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Third round he knocked Ben down, and odds again increased in his
favour.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After this, Ben reassumed his advantage, and kept it to the end. In this
round (the fourth) both combatants seemed to throw aside skill, and, entering
upon a rally, totally depended on strength and courage. At the expiration
of twenty minutes, Johnson drew back, and springing in with a desperate
blow at Ben, which the latter evaded, broke the metacarpal bone of his middle
finger by striking the rail of the stage. At first this severe accident did not
seem to affect his spirits and he manœuvred actively; but shortly afterwards
Ben put in two successive blows which decided the turn of battle. One
struck him in the ribs, another dreadfully cut his lip.” Another account
describes Johnson as “holding Ben by the hair to prevent his striking,
so unlike his conduct in former fights.” All, however, did not avail; the
die was cast, and Ben Brain was the undisputed conqueror in eighteen rounds,
occupying no more than twenty-one minutes. We resume the report:—“Johnson,
in this battle, did not preserve that coolness and regularity of
temper which hitherto have caused him to be considered so admirably
pre-eminent as a safe boxer. His wind was good, but the first knock-down
blow so much disconcerted him that he frequently shifted, and went back.
Ben, however, seldom advanced, at least not at the instant, and when he did,
he kept up good guard, and penned Johnson in without room to manœuvre,
compelling him to fight out of it if he could. Though Johnson was so heavily
punished, in appearance Ben seemed little hurt, and on the Monday following
he displayed great agility in a sparring match at the Grecian Theatre, in the
Strand.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c009'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>After four years’ interval, during which Ben appears now and then as
a second, our hero accepted a challenge from Will Wood, the coachman,
to fight on the 24th of February, 1794. Though Ben’s health had been in a
precarious state, the odds were largely in his favour. But a more formidable
adversary declared himself: a scirrhous liver deranged Ben’s vital functions;
his disease ran on rapidly, and on the 8th of April, 1794, the Champion died
in full possession of the honour, at his dwelling in Gray’s-Inn-Road. On the
Friday following (the 11th) we find him among the burials in St. Sepulchre’s
churchyard. His funeral, which was conducted with the solemnity such
occasions demand, was attended by his old friends and professional
brothers, Johnson, Warr, Wood, Symonds, and several others of inferior
note.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>A pugilist wrote the following epitaph for his tombstone:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Farewell, ye honours of my brow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Victorious wreaths, farewell!</div>
      <div class='line'>One blow from Death has laid me low,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>By whom such brave ones fell.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yet bravely I’ll dispute the prize,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nor yield, though out of breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis not a fall—I yet shall rise,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And conquer even Death!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Of which rhymes we can conscientiously say the anonymous “brother
pugilist” of Ben need not have been ashamed; for far worse have been
written on marble by “unco’ guid folk” who would scorn to bestow a
glance on the grave of a boxer.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>DANIEL MENDOZA—1784‒1820.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c009'><sup>[51]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c013'>The conveniences of the plan of a biographical history the editor flatters
himself are by this time sufficiently obvious to the reader: the index of
names and of events at the end of the volume, and the grouping of the
memoirs into Periods, bringing the men who contended their most important
battles with each other into close companionship in our pages.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the introducer of a new, a more rapid, and more elegant style of boxing,
and a more artistic <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tactique</span></i>, the Israelitish champion Mendoza deserves the
distinction of heading a division of followers and pupils. Accordingly we
begin with his pugilistic career, to be succeeded by those of his clever
antagonists, Richard Humphries and Mr. John Jackson, Bill Warr, Tom
Owen, Paddington (Tom) Jones, etc., with Stanyard, George Ingleston,
Fewterel, and many minor stars in the Appendix, and in foot-notes, where
their conflicts with more distinguished boxers have preserved their names
from oblivion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Daniel Mendoza</span>, one of the most elegant and scientific boxers recorded
in the annals of pugilism, was born in the year 1763, of Jewish parents, in
the vicinity of Whitechapel. Of his earlier years nothing worthy of record
is known. His first noted pugilistic contest took place at Mile End, in 1784,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>with a big rough, known by the name of Harry the Coalheaver. Dan
appears to have polished off this black diamond in forty minutes—at least, so
says “Boxiana;” yet so far from being drawn from his regular employment
and pursuits by this triumph, his name does not figure until 1787. Shortly
after, Dan rose like a phenomenon in the fistic horizon, where he long
sparkled a star of the first magnitude. His advent was unquestionably a
new feature in the practice of the art, and his style of fighting gave rise to
much controversy and animadversion among the cognoscenti.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c009'><sup>[52]</sup></a> So far as it
was illustrated in his own practice, it was substantial and complete; and it
may be candidly allowed that whenever Mendoza failed, it was rather from
insufficient muscular strength, and being overmatched in weight, than any
deficiency of skill or courage. It has been contended that there was more
elegance about his positions than strength, and more show than utility. No
pugilist ever stopped with greater neatness, hit oftener, or put in his blows
quicker, than Mendoza; but they often failed in doing that execution which
might have been expected from want of force. In height about five feet
seven inches, with a well-formed manly chest, and arms of a strong athletic
nature; a courage never impeached; and possessing wind that was seldom
disordered, his battles were numerous and well-contested.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 17th of April, 1787, Mendoza made his first public appearance in
the lists, on Barnet race-course, with Martin, the Bath butcher, an opponent
of Humphries, and of great provincial reputation. The victory was well
disputed, Mendoza exhibiting thus early those points of excellence which
soon afterwards ripened to perfection. The battle was for 25 guineas, and
in twenty minutes the Bath boxer acknowledged that the young Israelite was
his master in the art. Humphries, who had last fought Martin, in the previous
year, had taken 105 minutes to dispose of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>This victory was much talked of, and already the youthful Jew was mentioned
as “the coming man” to lower the pretensions of “the Gentleman
Boxer.” In 1787, a casual rencontre took place between these great rivals,
at the Cock, at Epping, in which rumour gave Humphries so much the best
that it led to a match in 1788, which, as Mendoza was defeated, will be
found in Chapter II., under Humphries. The superiority of the latter was,
however, a matter of very serious question with the most competent judges,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>and their doubts were proved valid by the sequel, for a second match was
made, the progress and result of which we now proceed to detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>May the 6th, 1789, was the day fixed for the long and anxiously expected
battle. The place fixed upon was Mr. Thornton’s park, near Stilton, Hunts.
In order to accommodate the spectators, a building was erected, enclosing a
space of forty-eight feet in diameter (“Boxiana” says “in circumference”),
with seats raised one above the other, capable of containing nearly three
thousand persons, the highest seat being eighteen feet from the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Humphries, attended by Tom Johnson, as his second, entered between one
and two o’clock, followed by Butcher, as his bottle-holder, and Harvey
Combe, Esq., the brewer and alderman, as his umpire. Mendoza immediately
afterwards made his appearance, attended by Captain Brown and
Michael Ryan, as his second and bottle-holder, having Sir Thomas Apreece
for his umpire. The seconds, according to agreement, retired to separate
comers on the setting-to. The reporter continues: “The first blow was
struck by Humphries at the face of his antagonist, which Mendoza stopping
with great adroitness, returned and knocked Humphries down. The second
and third rounds terminated in precisely the same manner. Astonishment at
the confidence and quickness of Mendoza was expressed by every spectator.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After the contest had lasted about forty minutes, in which Mendoza,
by generally catching his opponent’s blows on his arm and returning with
his left hand, or throwing him, had indisputably the advantage of the combat,
it was stopped by a circumstance that created the greatest confusion on both
sides.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the twenty-second round, Mendoza having struck at Humphries, the
latter dropped. The articles of agreement particularly specified that whichever
combatant fell ‘without a blow,’ should lose the battle. Consequently
a general cry of ‘Foul! foul!’ took place, and it was declared by
Mendoza’s friends that he had won the battle. Humphries, Johnson, and
the spectators interested on that side of the question, contended it was fair,
asserting that Humphries had stopped the blow before he fell. The partizans
on the opposite side as vehemently insisted on the contrary, and the whole
was a scene of uproar and confusion. Sir Thomas Apreece, as the umpire of
Mendoza, declared it foul, but Alderman Combe refused giving an opinion.
During this affray, Captain Brown (Mendoza’s second) in a moment of irritation
called Johnson a liar and a blackguard, which was answered by the
approach of Johnson in a stern and menacing manner. This led to the
expectation of a bye-battle between the seconds. Humphries came several
times to his adversary, calling on him to fight out the battle, but Mendoza’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>friends would not permit him. Humphries then threw up his hat, and
challenged him again to the combat. However, numbers present said, that
this went no way to the decision of the point in dispute, and the battle most
likely would have been a drawn one, had not Mendoza, by the advice of his
friends, or perhaps irritated by his adversary’s continually taunting him for
not continuing the fight, consented to resume the contest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They again set-to, and the first two rounds terminated by Mendoza’s
knocking down his adversary. They fought for about half an hour, Mendoza
all the time evidently holding the advantage, and at last gained the victory,
by Humphries again violating the articles of agreement. In the last round,
after some blows had passed, Humphries had given way, Mendoza followed
him up, and was preparing to strike, when his opponent fell, obviously
without receiving any blow. Mendoza was immediately declared the
conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mendoza in this battle displayed great superiority of skill. Humphries
allowed his antagonist to gain ground upon him during the whole combat;
and when he was preparing to strike, he always flinched. Mendoza, on the
contrary, stood up to his man manfully, and followed him with coolness and
resolution, which proved much more serviceable to him than the impetuosity
of temper he displayed in his last contest with Humphries at Odiham.
Several times, when Humphries was in the act of setting-to, he walked up
to him, and viewing him with a keen look, seemed contemptuously to drop
his guard. When Humphries closed, he several times said to Mendoza,
‘Very well, indeed—very well!’ and which Mendoza, when he succeeded in
throwing him, repeated in a mocking tone of irony. Nevertheless, during
the whole contest, up to his fall, the bets were in favour of Humphries.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The only blows of consequence received by Mendoza were one on the
cheek, and several on the ribs and back at the time of closing. Towards the
end of the contest Humphries aimed several very severe darts at the pit
of the stomach, which were admirably stopped by Mendoza; had they
reached their aim, they might have proved fatal to his chance. Humphries
was much beaten about the face; one eye was closed, and his forehead cut
above the other; his lip was also cut, and he frequently spat blood, but we
think the hemorrhage was merely from the last-mentioned wound.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Humphries was by no means satisfied of the Jew’s superiority, and
persisted he had been “wrangled” out of the fight. A third trial by battle
was therefore sought by him, and readily agreed to. We copy the report.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Third Fight between DANIEL MENDOZA and GEORGE HUMPHRIES, at Doncaster, September 29th, 1790.</span><br /><br /><em>From an original Picture.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“September 29th, 1790, is rendered memorable in the annals of pugilism
by the well-fought third battle between the celebrated champions Humphries
and Mendoza. An inn-yard at Doncaster was pitched upon as the spot for
the decision of the contest. The time (the Sellinger and Cup week), and the
place were capitally chosen. The ground was bounded on two sides by the
backs of houses, at one end by the inn, at the other by a strong palisade,
behind which ran the river Don.” Upwards of 500 tickets at half-a-guinea
were sold, and the persons admitted. But the Yorkshire “tykes” of
humbler means were not to be baffled; and a ‘cute ferryman having brought
over some hundreds at sixpence a-head, the crowd outside soon demolished
the paling, stout as it was, and an immense concourse got in. The spectators
seated around the stage, however, prevented any inconvenience or
interruption of the principal performers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At about half-past ten Humphries made his appearance, immediately
followed by Mendoza; the former mounted the stage, which was about four
feet high, and twenty-four square, with astonishing agility, evidently in
high spirits. Mendoza also seemed equally alert and devoid of apprehension.
Ward seconded Humphries, and Jackson was his bottle-holder; Colonel
Hamilton being chosen by him as his umpire. Tom Johnson was second to
Mendoza, and his bottle-holder Butcher. Sir Thomas Apreece, who was
umpire for Mendoza on his last battle with Humphries, at Stilton, was also
chosen on this occasion, and Mr. Harvey Aston was mutually agreed upon as
the third umpire, should any altercation arise during the combat, and a
difference of opinion arise between the Colonel and Sir Thomas with respect
to its decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Everything being thus arranged, the combatants began to strip. Odds
were laid five to four in favour of Mendoza, and readily accepted by
Humphries’s friends, who considered that although perhaps it might be
impossible for him to beat the Jew by carrying on the fight regularly and in a
scientific style, yet, by his impetuous exertions at the commencement, would
be able to overcome his antagonist, and bear away the palm.”</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Round</span> 1.—The onset of Humphries was
bold and astonishingly vigorous, but was repelled
by Mendoza with equal force; they
mutually closed, struggled, and both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The same vigorous spirit was manifested
on both sides, but Humphries struck
the most blows, though apparently without
overpowering Mendoza.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—This round was fought with much
caution on both sides, each being equally
careful of giving or receiving a blow; what
passed, however, were in Mendoza’s favour,
and it terminated by his giving Humphries a
knock-down blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—They engaged, but only for a few
moments.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Humphries aimed a severe blow at
Mendoza’s stomach, which he dexterously
stopped, and struck him in the face; this
blow, however, Humphries returned, but at
the same time fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>“A number of rounds after this took place,
but in every one of them Mendoza evidently
had the advantage, and odds had risen forty
to five, and ten to one in his favour; Humphries
continually fell, sometimes in consequence
of blows, but more frequently from a
policy often used in boxing, which perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>may be considered fair; several times he
sunk without a blow, which conduct, although
contrary to the articles of agreement, was
passed unnoticed, as his general manners
placed him above the suspicion of cowardice.
For although he had undoubtedly the worst
throughout the battle, he fought with great
resolution, and even when his friends, perceiving
him conquered, and one eye perfectly
closed, persuaded him to yield, he
solicited to fight a little longer. Notwithstanding
all this display of excellent bottom,
he was again obliged to acknowledge the
ascendancy of the Israelite.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Mendoza was very much cut about the
left side of his head, his left eye and ear
being much mutilated, and he had received a
severe cut in the ribs on the right side by a
projectile left-handed blow of his antagonist.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Humphries had several hits which drew
blood under his left arm; his right eye was
closed early in the battle, and he had a
severe cut over his left. He had a wound
clear as a razor cut by the left side of his
nose by a straight-forward springing blow of
Mendoza’s. The same hit also split his upper
lip. He was carried through the crowd on
the shoulders of his friends, who conveyed
him in a post-chaise out of the town. Mendoza
walked on the race-ground on the Town
Moor for some time after the combat, ‘the
observed of all observers.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Money was collected from the spectators and amateurs present, as a prize
to be fought for between Aaron Mendoza, a cousin of the successful champion,
and Packer, a West-country boxer; the former was seconded by Johnson, and
the latter by Ward. It was a most severe contest; they fought for an hour
with the greatest violence, when on closing, they fell, and when down,
Aaron being uppermost, Packer raised his knee, and so threw him a perfect
somerset against the railing.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c009'><sup>[53]</sup></a> This decided the battle, and Packer was
declared the conqueror.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dan spent the year 1791 in a sparring tour; for like most of the “prophets”
he had an eye to the “jewels of gold and the jewels of silver” to be collected
from the Gentiles. He crossed from Liverpool to Ireland, and there we find
one “Squire Fitzgerald,” a swell of “great weight” and little prudence,
tried his “prentice han’” on Dan. He soon found he had a workman to
deal with, for Mendoza soundly thrashed him in twenty minutes, on the
2nd of August, 1791, fully demonstrating the striking difference between
professionals and amateurs in boxing as in most other arts and sciences.</p>

<p class='c007'>On his return to “Duke’s Plashe,” the Fancy, who had been looking out
for the triumphant Jew, decided that Bill Warr<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c009'><sup>[54]</sup></a> was a likely man to lower
the pride of Dan, and a match was made to come off in June, 1791. Stokenchurch,
in Oxfordshire, was named as the rendezvous. As, however, the
company were on the road, they received intimation that the magistrates of
Oxfordshire were resolved to prevent the battle. Upon this the cavalcade
stopped at Uxbridge, and an arrangement was made to fight in Fenner’s
Cricket Ground. Objections were, however, started, and the Duke of
Hamilton, on the part of Warr, and Alderman Macaulay, on the part of
Mendoza, agreed that they should postpone the affair till the Doncaster
Meeting in September; all bets to stand over. Here, however, the old cup
and lip proverb was verified; the authorities interposed, and the treat was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>postponed till May 14th, 1792, when the venue was changed to Smitham
Bottom, near Croydon. On this eventful morn pedestrians out of number,
and vehicles of every quality, were seen in rapid motion, eager to arrive at
the destined spot. Between one and two the combatants appeared upon the
stage, and were greeted with shouts of applause. Mendoza had for his second
and bottle-holder, Tom Johnson and Butcher, with Harvey Aston, Esq., as
his umpire; Warr was attended by Joe Ward and Jackson, and Mr. Watson
as umpire.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the commencement of the fight the odds were in favour of Warr; and
much was expected from his well-known skill and strength. For the first
eight rounds of the battle he fought tremendously; and in the fourteenth he
succeeded in nailing Mendoza on the jaw in such a style that the Star
of Israel came down with uncommon violence. Warr’s friends were now
in high spirits, as it was thought that Dan had received a sickener; but his
game soon brought him about, and he finished two successive rounds by
flooring his opponent cleverly. The superiority of Mendoza now became
manifest, Warr perceived he was in the hands of his master, and the
spectators began to change their opinions. Mendoza knocked down his
antagonist every round; nevertheless, Warr fought gamely an uphill battle,
and put in some good hits. In the twenty-third round the combatants closed,
Warr was completely exhausted, and Mendoza falling on him, he reluctantly
gave in. This victory established Dan’s fame as a game man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, Bill Warr fancied that in another trial he might regain his
laurels; accordingly a match was made to come off in January, 1794, near
Hounslow, but the magistrates interfering, it was postponed till the 12th of
November following, when it was decided upon Bexley Common.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opening of the battle was good, and Warr seemed to feel that he
should accomplish his wish; as before, in the earlier rounds he seemed
to have a slight advantage, and his opponent fell before him. Whether
Mendoza permitted him to show himself off in this manner that he might
be enabled to exhibit his great superiority afterwards, or that he could not
resist the efforts of his antagonist, cannot be ascertained; but it was evident
that he treated all the attempts of Warr with perfect coolness, and seemed
quite confident of the success of his waiting game. In the fifth round he
went in, stopped the hits of his opponent with the greatest ease, and returned
so tremendously, that Bill was disposed of in the short space of fifteen
minutes! It was clear that Warr, from the moment Mendoza assumed the
offensive, was lost; his opponent’s confidence completely overawed him, and
it was visible that he laboured under its depressing effects.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>But amid all his glory he was doomed to experience the vicissitudes of
fortune by a mortifying defeat in his contest with Mr. Jackson, at Hornchurch,
on April 15, 1795, which will be detailed in the memoir of Mr.
<span class='sc'>John Jackson</span>. This preyed so much upon his feelings that, after six years
had elapsed, they burst forth with fury, occasioned by the following circumstance.
Jem Belcher, after defeating Burke at Hurley Bottom, challenged
Dan to fight, who immediately replied, that he had given up pugilism,
and supported by his industry (as a publican, at the Lord Nelson, in Whitechapel),
a wife and six children, and only wished to fight Jackson, who had
dealt unhandsomely by him as a pugilist; and he now publicly declared
himself ready to enter the lists with him for 100 guineas, provided that
he would not take the unmanly and cowardly advantage of holding his hair.
This speech of Mendoza’s was soon trumpeted abroad, and some busy persons
inserted a sort of challenge to Mr. Jackson in the <cite>Oracle</cite> and <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>,
which was immediately answered by the latter. The letters, as mere
specimens of the ring correspondence of the time are given under the head of
<span class='sc'>Jackson</span>. It will be observed that Mendoza asserts therein that he had
fought <em>thirty-two</em> pitched battles, and Pierce Egan makes up a list to that
amount of names, which, for aught the records of pugilism show, may have
been selected from the London Directory.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c009'><sup>[55]</sup></a> It will be, however, to the point
to give one of Mendoza’s letters, from which it would seem that Dan’s
challenge was not, in the first instance, inserted with his permission.</p>

<p class='c019'><em>To the Editor of the</em> <span class='sc'>Daily Advertiser</span>.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Mr. Editor</span>,—It was with inexpressible concern that, in your paper of Wednesday last, I
observed a letter signed “John Jackson,” purporting to be an answer to a supposed challenge
from me, inserted in your detailed account of the recent pugilistic contest at Maidenhead.
Mistake me not, Sir. I was not concerned at the contents of Mr. Jackson’s elegant effusion,
nor in the least affected or surprised at the opprobrious falsity, brazen impudence, or
malignant calumny of his assertions, which I deny <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</span></i>; but felt particularly hurt at the
idea that I was compelled either to sit down tamely under injury, or incur the risk of
offending my best friends, and particularly the respectable magistrates of this division, by
resuming a profession which, both from principle and conviction, I had wholly relinquished.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>In order satisfactorily to refute Mr. Jackson’s allegations, it is only necessary to observe
that a month after our battle at Hornchurch I waited on him, upbraided him with his
unmanly conduct, by laying hold of my hair, and offered to fight him for 200 guineas.
Jackson proposed to fight for 100 guineas; and upon that sum being procured, declined
fighting under 500 guineas. Here was courage, here was consistency, here was bottom, and
yet Mr. Jackson is a man of honour and of his word!!!</p>

<p class='c018'>Mr. Editor, after this I left London for five years, which may easily account to Mr.
Jackson for the interval of silence. I have fought thirty-two pitched battles—four with
Humphries (three of which I won), and two with Will Warr, in both of which I was
victorious; these two men were both game, and good fighters, and of course, having received
so many blows, my only motive for wishing again to fight Mr. Jackson must be that spirit of
honour and retaliation ever inherent in the breast of man.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mr. Editor, I repeat that I am delicately situated. I wish to fight Mr. Jackson, and
intend it; but that, from a dread of injuring my family, by offending the magistrates as a
challenger in a newspaper (which would be indecorous in a publican), I can only observe,
that I should be very happy to see, as soon as possible, either Mr. Jackson or his friends, at
my house, where they shall receive every attention from me, as I wish most earnestly to convince
the world what a deep and just sense I entertain of all Mr. Jackson’s favours conferred
upon</p>

      <div class='line'>DANIEL MENDOZA.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Mendoza, in the year 1806, again introduced himself to the notice of the
public in a diffuse correspondence, arising out of a personal quarrel with
Harry Lee. Those curious may read the whole in “Boxiana,” vol. i.
pp. 272‒276. We learn from it incidentally that Dan, after his retirement
from the ring, was an officer of the Sheriff of Middlesex, a favourite Jewish
calling in the days of arrest on mesne process and of sponging-houses.
Harry, in his last letter, accepts the challenge of Dan, which is all we care
about the quarrel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Harry was well known as an elegant sparrer, but his ring capabilities were
untried. He was also taller, younger, and more active than the veteran
Dan.</p>

<p class='c007'>On March 21, 1806, at Grinstead Green, a short distance beyond Bromley,
in Kent, the combatants met, and 50 guineas were the stakes deposited. It
was a roped ring of twenty-five feet. Mendoza had for his second his old
opponent and firm friend, Bill Warr, and for his bottleholder, Bill Gibbons;
Harry Lee was attended by the Game Chicken and John Gully. The odds
were three to one that Dan proved the conqueror.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Mendoza, with his piercing
black eye, looked at his opponent with scornful
contempt, and a more than usual degree
of confidence. Lee soon showed he was no
novice in the art. He stood well up, with
his left arm extended, and tried rather artfully
to pop in a hit over Mendoza’s guard;
but the latter stopped several of these, and
eventually sent Harry down. The odds rose
ten to one on Dan, and the bets were decided
respecting the first knock-down and first
blood.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Lee rose exasperated, the claret flowing
copiously. Mendoza made a hit, which
was neatly returned by Lee upon Dan’s nose—they
closed and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Lee, out of temper, went in to mill
away; but Mendoza punished him right and
left for his temerity, and he saluted his
mother earth.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Lee now convinced the spectators that
he was something more than a sparrer, by
showing game—he put in a good hit over
the left eye of Mendoza; but Dan threw him
in the close. The opinions of the cognoscenti
began to waver, for it appeared not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>quite so easy a thing as imagined; and two
to one was sported that Mendoza did not
beat Lee in half an hour.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Lee, not destitute of pluck, attempted
to rally; but Mendoza, aware of his intentions,
put in so severe a blow, that Harry
went under the ropes. Three to one against
Lee.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Mendoza, experienced in all the manœuvres
of the art, with the coolness of the
veteran, judging that his opponent would
attempt another rally, waited for him with
the greatest composure; as he came in Dan
put in a tremendous hit over Harry’s nose,
and threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Of no account.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Lee, trusting to impetuosity more than
judgment, went in rapidly; but the folly of
such conduct was self-evident—Mendoza hit
him away with the greatest ease, following
him, and, in the event, throwing him a
cross-buttock. Lee’s frontispiece had now a
variegated appearance.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Lee, full of gaiety, rallied; but Mendoza
hit him sharply over the left eye, which
was already terribly swelled. Five to one
on Mendoza.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Dan laughed at his opponent; who
made a feeble hit and fell upon his knees.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—It appeared from Lee’s conduct that
he entertained an idea that his opponent was
to be conquered by impetuosity. He rushed
in most furiously, when the latter hit him;
Harry retreated and took refuge upon the
ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Mendoza thought it was necessary to
show a little fight, and, in a sharp rally,
quickly punished his opponent out of the
ring.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Rallying was the order of the day
with Lee; Dan put in a severe hit, and, to
avoid going down, Harry caught hold of his
opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Mendoza struck his adversary, who,
to the astonishment of the spectators, laid
himself down as before. (Some hisses and
disapprobation occurred; and cries of  “Foul—take
him away!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Trifling away time; Lee went down
without a hit, and Dan laughed at him. (Six
to one against Lee.)</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Mendoza waiting for his opponent,
hit him in the throat, which more than
tickled him, and he fell from its effects, to
all appearance extremely weak. (The odds
now were out of comparison: a guinea to
half-a-crown was offered.)</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Lee went to the ground on the first
blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Mere flourishing-the men closed and
fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Harry, quite gay, tried what effect
another rally might produce; but Mendoza’s
sagacity rendered the attempt futile. He
gave Lee a desperate blow upon the chin,
which not only cut it severely, but sent him
under the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Mendoza laughing at the insufficiency
of his opponent’s attempts—who now appeared
quite passionate—stopped Harry’s
blows with the greatest <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>. In
closing, both went to the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Dan gave Lee so severe a body hit
that it instantly floored him. (All betters,
no takers.)</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—As Mendoza made himself up to
strike his opponent, Lee fell. (Cries of
“Foul!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Of no consequence-both closed and
fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Lee, still fond of rallying, tried it on;
but Mendoza hit him away easily, and Lee
slipped down.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Mendoza, as if expecting Lee would
rally again, was perfectly prepared for the
attempt. Lee went in, and got punished
right and left, finally going to the ground,
much exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—Dan, full of spirits and vigour, as
soon as Lee stood up gave him a floorer.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—Lee, in making a hit, lost his distance
and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—This was a most singular round.
Harry went in to his opponent, and by main
force threw him down by the arm.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—A rally on both sides—Lee, undismayed,
put in several hits: in the close
Mendoza was uppermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—The science of Dan was truly conspicuous,
he stopped every blow; but happening
to slip, Lee put in some facers as
Mendoza was going down.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—Of no note whatever.</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—Dan appeared rather fatigued, in
making a blow he went down upon his
knees.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—Lee now endeavoured to show that
his spirits were in good trim, and made the
best use of his knowledge, which was by no
means mediocre; but it was in vain: his
heart was better than his skill, and Dan
milled him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>34.—Both the combatants fought well;
but the turn was in Dan’s favour.</p>

<p class='c022'>35.—Mendoza sent Lee under the ropes,
from a well-directed blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>36.—Dan repeated the dose.</p>

<p class='c022'>37. 38, 39.—In all these rounds the superiority
of Mendoza was manifest: Dan
stopped and hit as he pleased.</p>

<p class='c022'>40.—Mendoza punished Lee’s ribs severely;
he fell from the effects of the blows.</p>

<p class='c022'>41.—Lee was now becoming much exhausted:
he fell from a mere touch.</p>

<p class='c022'>42.—Lee began to be convinced that the
chances were against him; his exertions were
on the decline. Mendoza did as he pleased,
and closed the round by throwing him.</p>

<p class='c022'>53.—For the last ten rounds Lee had not
the smallest prospect of success; still his
game prompted him to continue the fight
in hopes that some lucky chance might
offer; but having fallen a second time
without a blow, Mendoza was declared
the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>The amateurs were completely surprised at the protraction of the above
fight, for one hour and ten minutes. It is certain that Lee was not equal to
the task of encountering so experienced and finished a pugilist as Mendoza;
but it is equally true that his conduct was entitled to honourable mention;
and, considering it was his first appearance in the ring, Lee acquitted himself
in a superior manner. That he was not wanting either in courage or resolution
was evident; and his scientific efforts, in several instances, were entitled to
much praise; indeed, he eradicated the prevalent idea that he was nothing
more than a sparrer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the amateurs present the reporter enumerates, Lords Albemarle
and Seften, Count Beaujolais, Sir Watkin Williams Wynne, Sir John
Shelley, Sir Eden Nagle, Captain Halliday, Squire Thornhill, General
Keppel, Messrs. Baxter, Fletcher Reid, Bagley, Challis, Robert Allen, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Year after year we find “Ould Dan,” with an eye to business, making
tours and exhibiting the “noble art,” of which he was unquestionably a
talented demonstrator. In the summer of 1819, Dan made a most successful
sparring tour, and we find him at Lincoln issuing a hand-bill, of which the
following is an extract:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Mendoza has the authority of members of the Senate and Judges
on the Bench in asserting the tendency of the practice of boxing to prevent
the more fatal resort to the knife or other deadly weapons. To
gentlemen it may prove more than an exercise or an amusement, by initiating
them in the principles of a science by which the skilful, though of
inferior strength, may protect themselves from the ruffian assault of the
powerful vulgar, or save their friends and those who are defenceless from
insult and imposition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already had occasion to observe the rarity of men believing in the
decline of their own physical capabilities; and Mendoza, unfortunately, must
be added to the list of those who, in the words of Captain Godfrey, when
speaking of Broughton, allow their “valour” so far to get the upper hand of
their “discretion” as to “trust a battle to waning age.” But other men, as
well as pugilists, are guilty of this mistake: we shall not therefore dwell
upon it further than to say that Dan ended his career, like so many other
celebrated men, in defeat, though by no means in disgrace.</p>

<p class='c007'>In July, 1820, being fourteen years from his last appearance within the
roped ring, Mendoza met Tom Owen, in a contest for fame and 50 guineas.
The battle arose from an old grudge; and although no one can doubt the
game of Tom Owen, as we shall duly note in our memoir of that boxer, yet
the frothy outpourings of the “Historian” in honour of his friend “Tom,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>and at the expense of Mendoza,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c009'><sup>[56]</sup></a> are as bad in taste as they are extravagant
in phrase. Be that as it may, Dan was defeated, and we need hardly add it
was his “last appearance” within the ropes, though not “upon any stage,”
the Fives Court being occasionally illuminated by his displays. In August,
1820, he made an “appeal” to the amateurs for “past services” to the
pugilistic state, and delivered the subjoined address, which breathes a tone of
reproach to the boxers as well as gratitude to his patrons:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>,—I return you my most sincere thanks for the patronage
you have afforded me to-day, and likewise for all past favours. To those
persons who have set-to for me to-day, I also acknowledge my gratitude;
and their services will never be forgotten by me. Gentlemen, after what I
have done for the pugilists belonging to the prize ring, I do say they have
not used me well upon this occasion; in fact, the principal men have deserted
me <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</span></i>. Gentlemen, I think I have a right to call myself the father of
the science; for it is well known that prize fighting lay dormant for several
years after the time of Broughton and Slack. It was myself and Humphries
that revived it in our three contests for superiority, and the science of pugilism
has been highly patronised ever since. (Hear, hear, from some old
amateurs.) Gentlemen, I have once more to thank you for the present, and
all other past favours; nay, more, I now take my leave of you, and I trust
that I shall never trouble you for another benefit. (Applause.) I have now
only to say—Farewell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From this period Dan’s life no longer belongs to the history of the ring.
We may, however, observe that for several years he supported a large family,
a wife and eleven children, as a publican, keeping the Admiral Nelson, in
Whitechapel. He died on the 3rd of September, 1836, among his “peoplesh”
in the East, in the region where he had been so long the milling star, at the
advanced age of 73.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mendoza was, in company, a shrewd, intelligent, and communicative man.
As a scientific professor of the art of self-defence it was Mendoza who trod
most immediately in the steps of Broughton. His success as a professor was
unrivalled; and there was scarcely a town in the kingdom where he did not
exhibit his finished talents to admiring and applauding assemblages. It
seems, from a work we have before us, published by Mendoza himself, and
containing much forgotten squabbling between himself and Humphries, that
he derived his first knowledge of the art, scientifically, from his elegant competitor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“the Gentleman Boxer.” But he so rapidly improved upon his
master’s system as to stand for years without a rival. No man of his time
united the <em>theory</em> of sparring with the <em>practice</em> of boxing so successfully as
Daniel Mendoza; and hence, as a distinctive feature, the “School of Mendoza”
marks a period in the <span class='sc'>History of Pugilism</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER II.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>RICHARD HUMPHRIES, “THE GENTLEMAN BOXER”—1784‒1790.</h4>

<p class='c013'>The popular cognomen of the “Gentleman Boxer” may give the cue to
the prepossessing appearance, quiet self-possession, and amenity of manners,
which contemporary writers agree in attributing to Richard Humphries.
“His attitudes,” says the author of “Sketches and Reminiscences,” already
quoted, “were remarkable for their impressive grace;” of course according
to the taste of the old school. We doubt if modern cognoscenti, as they
inspect our faithful copy of a contemporary engraving, will endorse the
opinion; but, as the Latin poet told us two thousand years ago, “times
change, and men change with them:”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c009'><sup>[57]</sup></a> though we must admit that our
progress has brought improvement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Humphries was about the middle size, 5 feet 8 inches, well-limbed, and
had practised boxing to great advantage. He was apt and ready; his blows
were effective; and his aims at the “mark,” or wind, and under the ear, are
talked of by contemporaries. Contrary to our modern notions, Humphries
puzzled his antagonists by hitting with his right at leading off, and stopping
with his left. He did not, however, like Mendoza, use both hands with
equal facility. His game was unquestionable, and he was justly esteemed a
model of pugilistic excellence. He was so attractive as to give a new and
increased impetus to the art of self-defence; and on the public announcement
that “the Gentleman Boxer” would fight Samuel Martin, the Bath
Butcher, on a stage at Newmarket, on the 3rd of May, 1786, the battle was
attended by their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and Duke of York
(<em>arcades ambo</em>), the Dukes of Orleans and De Fitzjames, and most of the
French nobility then in England, with a crowd of the best and bravest of the
land. A guinea was the admission-fee, which hundreds cheerfully paid, to
go to the winner, and between £30,000 and £40,000 awaited the wager
of battle.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Sam Martin<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c009'><sup>[58]</sup></a> was a boxer of some repute, shorter than Humphries,
strongly made, a little heavier, and had seen some service in the field of
battle. The set-to was remarkable for science, Humphries parrying
Martin’s attacks with singular adroitness, and standing up to Martin manfully.
Martin seemed deficient in distance, and occasionally fell; hence his
deliveries were ineffective. Humphries retained his position of favourite.
Martin, finding himself kept out of distance, went in boldly. Humphries
exchanged, and fought “with” his man, till the betting became equal.
Humphries appeared the stronger man, giving his opponent a most tremendous
knock down, which brought the odds to his favour. Martin, notwithstanding,
appeared game, and fought well, contesting every inch of ground;
and it was not until after a determined combat of an hour and three quarters,
(“Boxiana” states three quarters of an hour) that Martin declared he had
had enough. The distinguished company were highly gratified, and Humphries
won—“golden opinions from all sorts of men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Numerous sporting men rallied round pugilism, and the professors of the
science were not without high and noble patrons. Royalty now frequently
witnessed the display of the art, accompanied by dukes, earls, honourables,
etc.; and men of the first distinction did not feel ashamed of being seen in
the ring, or acting as umpires at a manly boxing match.</p>

<p class='c007'>The science, courage, and gentleman-like conduct of Humphries had
secured him many friends; and, with a mind by no means destitute of
intelligence, he could not fail in obtaining admiration and respect. But,
deservedly distinguished as Humphries stood in the boxing hemisphere,
a competitor arose to share his fame and glory, if not to aspire to superiority.
He was not only a daring, but a most formidable rival, as his pretensions to
pugilistic excellence were known to be sound. He had been proved, and his
displays of skill in trying conflicts had made a deep impression upon the best
judges. As there was beyond this a personal jealousy and rivalry, there
was little difficulty in bringing together Daniel Mendoza and Richard
Humphries.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>We have already noticed the preliminary brush between the rivals at the
“Cock,” at Epping.</p>

<p class='c007'>Preliminaries being agreed to, Odiham, in Hampshire, was fixed upon as
the place, and 400 guineas as the sum for which these masters of the art
should contend. A raised twenty-four feet stage was prepared, in a paddock,
and the door-money was to be divided between the combatants. On the day
(January 9, 1788) being announced, the anxiety which prevailed upon
the decision of this tourney was unprecedented. Odiham was then a distance
from town; it is now a steam steed’s “stride.” Everybody was there, for
Humphries and Mendoza were to fight. In the towns and villages near the
scene of action, the country people were equally interested, and innumerable
pedestrians were seen in all directions moving towards the fight, so that
within an hour previous to the battle the multitude collected was truly
astonishing. To prevent the combatants from being bilked of the door-money
(which was half a guinea each), the most athletic of the milling
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps</span></i> were selected for the protection of the entrance, and the potent arms of
Dunn, Ryan, Warr, and Tring, assisted by other powerful pugilists, kept for
some time order in the crowd. But, as the time drew near for the
combatants to mount the stage, John Bull’s anxiety increased beyond every
other thought; and, with one desperate effort, the “majesty of the people,”
like a mighty flood, swept all before it. The door-keepers were soon lost in
the violence of the torrent, and thousands never gave themselves the trouble
of asking the price of admission. All was noise, uproar, and confusion, for
some minutes; but upon the appearance of the combatants their attention
was so completely riveted that silence instantly prevailed.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to our practice, whenever procurable we quote the report:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“About one o’clock on Wednesday (January 9th, 1788), Humphries
ascended the stage amid the cheers of the spectators, attended by Tom
Johnson as his second, Tom Tring as his bottle-holder, and Mr. Allen as his
chosen umpire. After bowing to all around, he proceeded to strip. His
dress, when prepared for the contest, was a pair of fine flannel drawers,
white silk stockings with gold-coloured clocks, pumps, and black shoe-ribands.
While Humphries was preparing, Mendoza mounted the stage,
and was received with reiterated plaudits. His second was David Benjamin;
his bottle-holder, Jacobs, both Jews; and his umpire, Mr. Moravia. Mendoza’s
dress was more plain than his opponent’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a few minutes the combatants were prepared for the onset, shook
hands, and immediately Mendoza assumed his attitude with the air of a
man determined on victory. Humphries appeared astonished, and both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>remained in serious expectation for some minutes before a blow was offered.
Mendoza struck first, but recoiling, slipped and fell; Humphries caught it,
and retreated. The second blow Mendoza gave his opponent brought him
down, and in the next round they closed, and Mendoza threw his adversary.
For full fifteen minutes did Mendoza attack with such violence and superiority,
that the odds, which at the beginning were two to one against him,
changed considerably in his favour; and during this time Humphries had
many falls, but still remained undaunted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whether the defensive mode of fighting adopted by Humphries in his
first onset was manœuvre, or the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouvelle</span></i> style in which he was attacked,
and the unexpected vigour of his antagonist, made him give way, cannot but
remain a matter of dispute. At the commencement of the battle Mendoza
drove him to the side of the rail, and, while his body was suspended, aimed a
blow at the bottom of his ribs, which undoubtedly would have decided the
battle, had not Johnson caught it. Mendoza’s friends immediately exclaimed,
‘foul, foul;’ but the umpires decided Johnson was perfectly justified in
acting as he had done, for that Humphries must be considered as being
knocked down.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c009'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“From the wetness of the day, the stage was extremely slippery, and this
was particularly unfavourable to Humphries: he therefore took off his shoes;
but silk stockings were ill calculated to remedy the inconvenience, and he
afterwards put on a pair of worsted stockings, in which he stood more firm,
and began to manifest great superiority. Having very much recovered
himself, he stood up to his antagonist, and with great dexterity threw
Mendoza, pitching him on the face, which cut his forehead above the right
eye, and very much bruised his nose. From this moment odds changed
again in favour of Humphries. He threw in a blow near the loins of his
antagonist, and in the next round planted a most severe one in the neck. In
this round Mendoza also struck him in the face; but slipping, he fell with
his leg under him, sprained his foot, and immediately gave in: he shortly
after fainted, and was carried off the stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The contest lasted twenty-nine minutes (twenty-eight minutes fifty-four
seconds), and it was acknowledged there never was more skill and science
displayed in any boxing match in this kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Bradyl, Humphries’ patron, not being on the ground, he immediately
forwarded to him the result in the following laconic style:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I have done the Jew, and am in good health.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“RICHARD HUMPHRIES.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>The Israelites were severe sufferers; but although Mendoza was defeated,
his fame and character as a pugilist were considerably increased. His style
of fighting was highly spoken of by the scientific; and at close quarters, and
as a quick hitter, he was evidently superior to his antagonist. The advantage
was also upon the side of Mendoza in strength of arm; and, when struggling
to obtain the throw, he punished his adversary considerably by keeping down
his head. His guard was excellent, and displayed a thorough knowledge of
the art; in consequence of keeping it closer to his body than that of his
adversary, his blows were given with more force when he hit out; and with
respect to stopping he was not inferior to Humphries. For elegance of
position, cool and prompt judgment, fortitude of manner, and force of blow,
however, he was thought much inferior. He wanted also that manly bearing
which was so apparent in Humphries, whose confidence rendered him so
apparently indifferent of self. In throwing, Mendoza, to the great surprise
of many, had the advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Humphries’ attitudes were of the most manly and tasteful description,
and, even in the most trying moments of the fight, his postures were considered
graceful. His intellectual capacity had rendered him more acquainted
with the properties of the human frame than pugilists in general; and his
habits of life had tended to make him more conversant and attractive in
society than fighting men perhaps think essentially necessary. His manners
were conciliatory, and he endeavoured through life to enact the gentleman.
His friends were materially increased by such conduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was extremely difficult to decide which was the neatest pugilist; so
much activity, science, elegance, and courage, were displayed upon both
sides, though extremely different as to character and manner: but it appeared
that Humphries, in the defensive position, although he kept his adversary at
a distance by extending his arms, lost that celerity and power which his hits
might have possessed had his arms been nearer his body.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thenceforward, the pugilistic career of Humphries was a fruitless attempt
to prevent his victor’s wreath from falling into the hands and adorning the
brow of his able Israelitish rival. Twice did he do all that man can do—his
best—to stem the advancing tide of fate, but in vain. How he struggled is
already written in the memoir of <span class='sc'>Mendoza</span>. Humphries lived for many years
after their last contest (September 29th, 1790), and died in respectable circumstances,
his calling being that of a coal-merchant in the Adelphi, Strand.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>MR. JOHN JACKSON—1788‒1795.</h4>

<p class='c013'>In penning the History of Pugilism, one object has been our polestar—a
desire on the one hand to avoid fulsome adulation, and, on the other, never to
cast undeserved censure: to “nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in
malice,” but to speak of men as they were, and as their actions proved them.</p>

<p class='c007'>These remarks appear appropriate to a notice of John Jackson, inasmuch
as, blinded by early prejudices, which no after information has tended to
dispel, and imposed upon by the contemptible sophisms and paltry libels of
lily-livered scribes, who “earn their dirty pay” by pandering to what they
suppose the taste of the reading public, no small proportion of that public
has taken it for granted that pugilism and blackguardism are synonymes.
It is as an antidote to these slanderers that we pen a candid history of
the boxers; and, taking the general habits of men of humble origin (elevated
by their courage and bodily gifts to be the associates of those more fortunate
in worldly position), we fearlessly maintain that the best of our boxers (we
take no account of outsiders, inasmuch as they have no claim to the designation,)
present as good samples of honesty, generosity of spirit, goodness of
heart, and humanity, as an equal number of men of any class of society.
But the manly art of self-defence—one of the most generous, noble, and
national traits of the English character—has never lacked detractors. The
mean-spirited, the treacherous, and the cruel can never be its admirers. But
does it appear that the mind is debased from witnessing such public displays?
would the usages of society be infringed upon if such exhibitions were
legalised? Are the feelings of men so blunted from these specimens of
hardihood and valour, as to prevent them from fulfilling those public situations
in life which many are called upon to perform, with fidelity, justice,
and reputation? We reply, no! and experience corroborates our assertion.
Were it otherwise, we should admit pugilism to be a disgrace to the country
where it is permitted, and boxers obnoxious to society.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “great moralist,” Samuel Johnson, surely saw the rough side of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>pugilism in his day; yet we read in his works, “Courage is a quality so
necessary for maintaining virtue, that it is always respected, even when
found associated with vice.” Without accepting the corollary of the ponderous
Doctor, himself—as in the case of the brewer’s servant in Fleet
Street, and of Davies, the bookseller in Covent Garden—a practical exponent
of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ars pugnandi</span></i><a id='t90'></a>, we are ready to appeal to the readers of these pages,
whether courage of the highest order, in the case of the leading pugilists, is
not associated with forbearance, humanity, and active benevolence?</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most respected public characters in the early part of this
century, whose patriotic attention to the preservation and due administration
of the laws; whose firmness in supporting, upon all occasions, the liberty of
the subject; whose dignity and consistency of conduct in representing the
first city in the world in Parliament; and who filled the office of Lord Mayor
of London, with honour to himself, and advantage to his fellow citizens,
was an ardent and firm patron of pugilism, and “a friend” of John
Jackson. We allude to Harvey Christian Coombe, Esq., whose name never
suffered the slightest tarnish from his patronage of the Old English custom
of boxing in the early part of his life; but, through a long and distinguished
career, proved his pretensions so clearly to the character of a real Englishman,
an honest citizen, and an independent senator, that in 1816 he was
returned a fourth time as member for the City of London.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another member of the senate, whose enlightened mind, classical acquirements,
and transcendent talents, shone at a time when wits and orators
were rife in St. Stephen’s Chapel, was the friend of John Jackson, and
of pugilism. To a mind stored with ancient and modern literature, conversant
with popular recreations in all their gradations, from the rusticity
of a cudgelling bout at a country fair to an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">assaut d’armes</span></i> in the aristocratic
fencing-school, the Right Hon. William Windham added a true English
spirit of fair play, when he thus publicly declared his sentiments:—“A
smart contest this, between Maddox and Richmond! Why are we to boast
so much of the native valour of our troops, as shown at Talavera, at Vimiera,
and at Maida, yet to discourage all the practices and habits which tend to
keep alive the same sentiments and feelings?” The sentiments that filled the
minds of three thousand spectators who witnessed those two pugilists were
the same in kind as those which inspired the higher combatants on that
occasion. It is the circumstances only in which they are displayed that
make the difference.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>There is no sense in the answer always made to this, ‘Are no men brave but
boxers?’ Bravery is found in all habits, classes, circumstances, and conditions.
But have habits and institutions of one sort no tendency to form it
more than another? Longevity is found in persons of habits the most opposite;
but are not certain habits more favourable to it than others? The courage
does not arise from mere boxing, from the mere beating, or being beat, but
from the sentiments excited by the contemplation and cultivation of such practices.
“Will it make no difference in the mass of people, whether their amusements
are all of a pacific, pleasurable, and effeminate nature; or whether they
are of a sort that calls forth a continued admiration of prowess and hardihood?”</p>

<p class='c007'>A slight anecdote, apropos of the prevalence of the taste for the use of the
“muffles,” as boxing-gloves were then called, will take us back to the days
when Vauxhall was in the height of its splendour. Old Tyers, then the
proprietor of the Gardens, had commissioned Hayman, the painter, to panel
the “Hall of British Worthies” with portraits of the heroes of our land.
The gallant and good-natured Marquis of Granby was waited upon by Tyers,
with a request that he would honour Hayman with a sitting. In consequence,
the hero of Minden dropped in at the artist’s studio in St. Martin’s Lane.
“But, Frank,” said the peer, “before I sit to you, I insist upon having a
set-to with you.” Hayman, astonished at the oddity of the observation,
affected not to understand his visitor, whereupon the Marquis exclaimed, “I
have been told that you are one of the last boxers of the school of Broughton,
and I flatter myself not altogether deficient in the pugilistic art; but since I
have been in Germany I have got out of practice, therefore I want a little
trial of your skill.” Hayman pleaded age and gout as obstacles to his consent.
To the first the Marquis replied, “There was very little difference
between them; and to the second, that he considered exercise as a specific
remedy,” adding, laughing, “besides, a few rounds will cause a glow of
countenance that will give animation to the canvass.” Hayman no longer
resisted; the gloves were donned, and to it they went. After a good display
of strength and science, Hayman delivered such a straight hit in the “breadbasket,”
that down they both went with a tremendous crash. This brought
up stairs the affrighted Mrs. Hayman, who found the academician and commander-in-chief
rolling over each other on the carpet like two unchained
bears. Frank, who was a humourist and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bon vivant</span></i>, often narrated this anecdote
of the nobleman,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>We cannot but think the reader will consider these slight notices of how
our fathers viewed the science of self-defence—now, for a season only, as we
trust, “fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf”—as a fitting preface to the life
of Jackson, who flourished in the palmy days of pugilism; one of “nature’s
gentlemen,” who not only supplanted Mendoza, but took a higher position in
the social scale than any boxer who preceded or followed him, no less from
the firmness and urbanity of his manners, than the high requisites he possessed
for shining as an athlete.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Jackson was born in London, in 1768, and was the son of an eminent
builder, by whom the arch was thrown over the Old Fleet Ditch, near the
mouth of the River Fleet, flowing from the Hampstead and Highgate Hills,
and crossed by bridges at Holborn and Ludgate. This forms the great sewer
of Blackfriars from the north into the new Low Level, over which run Farringdon
Street (the site of the old Fleet Market), and Bridge Street, leading
to the splendid bridge by Cubitt, with its ugly iron companion carrying the
L. C. &amp; D. R. John Jackson’s uncles were farmers, and tenants of the Duke of
Bedford and the Marquis of Hertford. Nature had bestowed upon him all those
athletic requisites which constitute the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</span></i> of perfect manhood. There
was a happy combination of muscular development with proportionate symmetry
in his frame (his height was five feet eleven, and his weight fourteen stone),
which rendered him a fitting model for the sculptor, and excited the admiration
of all those by whom these qualities are appreciated. At the age of nineteen
he became a frequenter of the sparring schools, and displayed such talents
as proved that he was destined to eclipse the most favoured of his cotemporaries;
added to which, possessing as he did the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">suaviter in modo</span></i> as well as
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fortiter in re</span></i>, he soon found patrons of the highest grade.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is stated that a conversation with Colonel Harvey Aston<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c009'><sup>[60]</sup></a> led to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>first encounter in the prize ring. Fewterel, a Birmingham boxer, as yet
unbeaten, had been the conqueror, says “Pancratia,” in eighteen battles.
The meeting took place at Smitham Bottom, near Croydon, June 9th, 1788.
We copy the report.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This day there were decided three boxing matches, which had been long
depending, and great bets were depending on. The first was between Jackson,
a fine young man of nineteen years only, and Fewterel,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c009'><sup>[61]</sup></a> of Birmingham.
Tom Johnson seconded Jackson, and Bill Warr, Fewterel; Humphries and
Dunn were the bottle-holders. Fewterel is a man of extremely great bulk,
so much so that, at first setting-to, it was doubted whether Jackson would
ever level such an opponent. Yet this he never failed to do when he could
plant his blows at distance. The contest lasted one hour and seven minutes;
its decision being very much procrastinated by Fewterel fighting shifty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>getting down to avoid a blow, and then remaining so long on the floor as
often to require the interposition of the umpires to remind his seconds of
‘time.’ Fewterel at last gave up the contest, and Major Hanger, by command
of the Prince of Wales, who was present, gave young Jackson a bank
note.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c009'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Jackson’s next contest (March 12th, 1789) was with George Ingleston, the
brewer. It closed by an untoward accident, by which Jackson broke the
small-bone of his leg, as will be seen under the head of Ingleston, in the
Appendix to Period II.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jackson’s next contest was one of the greatest interest to the pugilistic
world. The victories of Mendoza had placed him on the pinnacle of fame;
and the attempt to defeat the conqueror of Sam Martin, of Humphries
(twice), of Bill Warr (twice), to say nothing of minor boxers, was viewed as
indeed a bold flight of young ambition. On April 15th, 1795, the men met
at Hornchurch, in Essex, for a stake of 200 guineas aside. We copy the
contemporary report:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“A twenty-four feet stage was erected in a most advantageous hollow,
which accommodated upwards of three thousand spectators, and so excellently
adapted that no one could claim a superiority of situation. All the eminent
patrons and amateurs were present: the Duke of Hamilton, Lord Delaval,
Sir John Phillipson, Mr. Clark, Mr. Bullock, Mr. Lee, Mr. Fawcett, etc.;
and among the pugilists of note were Jackling, Will Warr and Joe Warr,
George the Brewer, Tom Tyne, Fearby (the Young Ruffian), etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At one o’clock Mendoza mounted the spot of combat, accompanied by his
second, Harry Lea, and Symonds (the Old Ruffian), as his bottle-holder.
Jackson immediately followed, with Tom Johnson as his second, and Wood,
the coachman, for his bottle-holder. The chosen umpires were Mr. Alexander
and Mr. Allen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They each politely bowed to the people, and were received with general
acclamations. About five minutes after one they, as usual, saluted each
other by shaking hands, and immediately set-to. Bets five to four in favour
of Mendoza.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Both having assumed their
attitude, displayed the greatest caution; full
a minute expired before a blow was struck,
when Jackson made a hit, and his antagonist
fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Mendoza guarded with great science,
avoided the blows of his opponent, and put
in several severe ones.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—In this round there was much hard
fighting. Odds rose two to one in favour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Mendoza, but the round terminated by Mendoza
falling.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—This was the most severely contested
round throughout the battle. Jackson seemed
to hold his opponent’s manœuvres in contempt,
followed him up with great resolution,
and put in some dreadfully severe blows, by
the last of which Mendoza fell, and his right
eye was much cut; Jackson now evidently
had the advantage.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—In this round Jackson caught his opponent
by the hair, and holding him down,
gave him several severe blows, which brought
him to the ground; Mendoza’s friends called
“foul,” but the umpires decided on the contrary.
Odds had now changed two to one
on Jackson.</p>

<p class='c022'>6, 7, 8.—Throughout these three rounds
Jackson supported his superiority. Mendoza
acted entirely on the defensive.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—This was the last round. Jackson
manifestly displayed astonishing advantage;
he several times struck his adversary, when
he fell quite exhausted, and gave in.</p>

<p class='c022'>The battle only lasted ten minutes and a-half,
and was acknowledged by every spectator
to be the hardest contested that ever was
fought in so short a time. Jackson was very
little hurt, leaping from the stage with great
agility, but Mendoza was quite cut up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A subscription purse was made and fought for between a Jew called
Black Baruk, who was seconded by Symonds (the Old Ruffian), and Burk
a glass-blower, seconded by James the waterman. It was very well contested
for half an hour, when a dispute arose about a foul blow, and it was
terminated by sharing the money between them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nearly seven years after his combat with Mendoza, a “gag” paragraph
having appeared in the newspaper, announcing a forthcoming fight as in
arrangement between Mendoza and Jackson, the latter inserted the following
letter to the Editor of the <cite>Oracle and Daily Advertiser</cite> of Wednesday,
December 1, 1801:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I was somewhat astonished on my return to town on Saturday, to learn that a
challenge was inserted in your paper on Thursday last, as if from Mr. Mendoza. Should I
be right in my conclusion, by believing that it came from that celebrated pugilist, I beg you
will inform the public through the medium of your paper, that for some years I have entirely
withdrawn from a public life, and am more and more convinced of the propriety of my
conduct by the happiness which I enjoy in private among many friends of great respectability,
with whom it is my pride to be received on terms of familiarity and friendship: goaded, however,
as I am to a petty conflict, I hope that it will not be considered too much arrogance on
my part simply to observe, that, after waiting for more than three years to accept the
challenge of any pugilist, however dexterous in the science, and however highly flattered by
his friends, I think it rather extraordinary that Mr. Mendoza should add a silence of four
years to those three, it being nearly seven years since I had the satisfaction of chastising him;
but Mr. Mendoza derived one great good from the issue of that contest—he was taught to be
less hasty in forming his resolutions, more slow in carrying them into effect.</p>

<p class='c018'>“This cautious and wise principle of action deserves much commendation; and having
served an apprenticeship of seven years to learn a certain portion of artificial courage, he
now comes forward with a stock of impudence (the only capital which during that time he
seems to have acquired) to force me to appear once more in that situation which I have for
years cheerfully avoided.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Reluctant, however, as I am to attract again, even for a moment, the public attention, I
shall have no objection to vindicate my character by a meeting with Mr. Mendoza when and
where he pleases, provided he’ll promise to fight, and provided he’ll also promise not to
give previous information to the magistrates at Bow Street, or elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c013'>Need we say that this was on the part of Mendoza a mere piece of that
absurd system of gagging then so much in vogue, and on which we have
elsewhere commented.</p>

<p class='c007'>Independent of his pugilistic prowess, Mr. Jackson was distinguished for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>his extraordinary powers as a runner of a short distance, and as a leaper no
man of his day was equal to him at a standing jump, of which many extraordinary
feats are on record. His muscular strength was equal to his bodily
activity, and in the presence of Mr. Harvey Coombe, and other gentlemen,
he lifted ten hundred weight and one quarter, and wrote his own name with
eighty-four pounds weight suspended from his little finger!</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most able and experienced sporting writers, the late Vincent
George Dowling, Esq., the founder, and for more than thirty years the editor
of <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>, has left on record a graceful tribute to the memory
of his friend of many years, John Jackson, in the form of an obituary notice.
From this we shall here make a few extracts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“John Jackson was an instance of the glorious truth which this country is
constantly evolving—that if a man be true to himself, he may defy the
obloquy and malice of millions. No matter in what grade of life a creature
be thrown; no matter whether from necessity or choice he mingles with
the learned or the illiterate, the high or the low; give him the attribute
of genius, or, if that be denied, honesty and perseverance, and he must
distinguish himself. The choice of a profession is the puzzle of boyhood—be
it so. <em>A profession never degraded a man, if that man took care not to degrade
his profession.</em>” This last axiom deserves to be written in letters of adamant;
it contains the philosophy we hope to inculcate by our pages. Mr. Dowling
continues: “As there always have been, and always will be, ruffians loose
upon society, who can only be met and quelled by the arguments such brutes
can appreciate; and as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Heads, nineteen in twenty, ’tis confest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Can feel a crabstick quicker than a jest,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>it is essential that boxing, as an art, should not fall into desuetude. It
empowers the little man to defend himself against the big one; makes the
weaker man, to a considerable extent, able to protect himself against the onset
of the stronger one, and, in some cases, to punish his want of skill and his
presumption. Doubtless much has been done in our great cities by gas and
an improved police; but even now things do occasionally occur to call upon
every man to know how with his own hands to defend his own head,
or, what is doubtless of more consequence, the heads of those near and
dear to him, or under his protection. Such a power is a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps de reserve</span></i>,
which, though it <em>may</em> never be called into action, it is valuable and assuring
to possess. So thought our grandfathers, so thought our grandfathers’
fathers in the days of Fielding. Boxing, to a gentleman, was a more
modern and practical application of knight-errantry; it enabled a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>to protect himself against aggression, and yet more, to defend an insulted
woman. ‘Good,’ exclaims the anti-pugilist, ‘but what say you to the
prize-fighter?’ The response is plain: He is the exemplar, the professor,
the demonstrator of a practice, of an exercise. Could or can the sword or
the bow be taught without professors, and can they teach without exemplifying?”&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
After a few facts, which will be found embodied in
our Memoir, Mr. Dowling concludes: “From 1785, Mr. Jackson ceased to
be a public pugilist, having fought but three battles, winning two, and not
gaining (for it cannot be called losing) the third by an accident. On
what basis, then, rests his fame as a thoroughly tried boxer? On none
whatever; the pedestal of his popularity was conduct, the keystone to fortune
in every grade of life. There is a singular similarity in the career of John
Jackson and John Gully: the latter fought but thrice, was beaten once,
won the other two, and then retired to enjoy a better fortune in a higher
sphere of society.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ere quitting the mere active sporting career of Mr. Jackson, it may be as
well to state that as a runner his speed was extraordinary, but he could not
last: he also excelled as a jumper until the celebrated Ireland “took the
shine out of all England.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The opening of “Jackson’s Rooms, 13, Old Bond Street,” was literally an
era in the gymnastic education of the aristocracy. Not to have had lessons
of Jackson was a reproach. To attempt a list of his pupils would be to copy
one-third of the then peerage. Byron, who was proud of being thought a
pugilist, has in his correspondence spoken highly of his tutor; but the fact is,
from lameness, the poet could neither hit nor stop effectively. When Jackson
taught the author of “Childe Harold,” he was forty-four, Byron about
twenty-three; the latter therefore stood a boy before a veteran. In a note
to the 11th Canto of “Don Juan,” we find this: “My friend and corporeal
pastor and master, John Jackson, Esquire, professor of pugilism, who I trust
still retains the strength and symmetry of his model of a form, together with
his good humour, and athletic as well as mental accomplishments.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And in his diary we read:—“Jackson has been here; the boxing world
much as usual, but the club increases (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Pugilistic Club). I shall dine
at Cribb’s to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He records going to this dinner thus: “Just returned from dinner with
Jackson (the Emperor of Pugilism), and another of the select, at Cribb’s, the
Champion’s.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next extract shows the author of “Childe Harold” actually in
training: “I have been sparring with Jackson for exercise this morning, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>mean to continue and renew my acquaintance with my muffles. My chest,
and arms, and wind are in very good plight, and I am not in flesh. I used
to be a hard hitter, and my arms are very long for my height (5 feet 8¼
inches); at any rate exercise is good, and this the severest of all; fencing
and the broadsword never fatigued me half so much.” This latter is dated
the 17th of March, 1814.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Got up, if anything, earlier than usual; sparred with Jackson <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
sudorem</span></i>, and have been much better in health for many days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Byron kept at his work, for we find him writing thus on the 9th of April,
1814: “I have been boxing for exercise for the last month daily.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In returning to the younger days of the “finest formed man in Europe,”
we shall take the liberty of borrowing a graphic colloquial sketch from the
lips of a veteran: “There were the Lades, the Hangers, the Bullocks,
the Vernons, but give me Jack Jackson, as he stood alone amid the throng.
I can see him now, as I saw him in ’84, walking down Holborn Hill,
towards Smithfield. He had on a scarlet coat, worked in gold at the buttonholes,
ruffles, and frill of fine lace, a small white stock, no collar (they were
not then invented), a looped hat with a broad black band, buff knee-breeches,
and long silk strings, striped white silk stockings, pumps, and paste buckles;
his waistcoat was pale blue satin, sprigged with white. It was impossible
to look on his fine ample chest, his noble shoulders, his waist, (if anything
too small), his large, but not too large hips (the fulcrum of the human form,
whether male or female), his limbs, his balustrade calf and beautifully
turned but not over delicate ankle, his firm foot, and peculiarly small hand,
without thinking that nature had sent him on earth as a model. On he
went at a good five miles and a half an hour, the envy of all men, and
the admiration of all women.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards his face nature had not been bountiful; his forehead was rather
low, and the mode he wore his hair made it peculiarly so. His cheek bones
were high, and his nose and mouth coarse. His ears projected too much
from his head, but his eyes were eyes to look at rather than look with; they
were full and piercing, and formed a great portion of his power as a pugilist—with
them he riveted his men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anatomists of the first standing examined Jackson, and artists and sculptors
without number took sketches and models of his arm; but it was the
extraordinary proportion of the man throughout that formed the wonder.</p>

<p class='c007'>After 1795 Mr. Jackson resolved to teach others the art in which he himself
excelled. For an instructor he had that invaluable requisite, temper;
he was never too fast with his pupils. This made his initiatory lessons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>tedious to young gentlemen who go ahead, and it may readily be conceived
that amid the aristocracy of England he had plenty of rough assailants to
deal with. But he was always on his guard; there was no chance of rushing
suddenly in and taking Jackson by surprise—he could not be flurried.
Amid the other qualifications he had studied Lavater, and managed to
reckon up his customers at first sight, and knew what he had to trust to.
It has been said “he defied any man to hit him;” this is the truth, but not
the whole truth—he defied any man to hit him whilst he (Jackson) stood
merely on the defensive; in a fight, of course, it is impossible to avoid being
hit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His sparring was elegant and easy. He was peculiarly light upon his
feet, a good judge of distance, and when he indulged his friends with
a taste of his real quality, the delivery of his blow was only observable in
its effect. It literally came like lightning, and was felt before it was seen.
Most big men are comparatively slow, but he was as rapid as Owen Swift or
Johnny Walker, and this, too, when upwards of fifty years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jackson not only told you what to do, but why you should do it; in
this essential point many capital instructors are and have been deficient.
The want of this power of explaining the purpose of an action made Young
Dutch Sam and Richard Curtis bad instructors, though they were finished
pugilists, and, which does not always follow, capital sparrers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jackson was not unmindful of the fact that art never ends. If there
was anything new in the gymnastic, equestrian, or pedestrian way, there be
assured was Jackson; not merely witnessing the exhibition, but examining
the means by which the effects were produced. He was consequently often
at Astley’s and at the Surrey, when Ireland, the jumper, was there, and
knew all the famous fencers, funambulists, dancers, and riders of his day,
and his day was a long one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of his private character, what can be said more than that all his pupils
became his friends. Save with Dan Mendoza, it is not known that he ever
had a quarrel. He was a careful man, not a mean man—saving, but not
penurious. It is to be remembered, too, from his peculiar situation, continued
calls were made upon his purse by the ruffianly and profligate, who
claimed a brotherhood that he utterly and properly repudiated.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1811, he procured a benefit at the Fives Court, in aid of the subscription
for the suffering Portuguese; it realised £114. Next year he
did the same for the British prisoners in France; this benefit amounted to
£132 6<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> He also aided the benefit for the Lancashire weavers (1826).</p>

<p class='c007'>One old boxer (but who was not of Jackson’s day) pestered him incessantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>for money. “No,” said Jackson, “I’ll give you no money; but you may go
to the Horse and Groom, and you will find a clean bed, three meals, and a
pot of beer a day; stay there until matters mend.” The man was thankful
in the extreme; but a week had not elapsed ere he was found in the taproom
bartering his dinner for gin!</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course a “lion” like Jackson could not avoid being made a “show”
of on particular occasions; accordingly, when the allied sovereigns were
in England, his aid was required. On the 15th of June, 1814, at the house
of Lord Lowther, in Pall Mall, a pugilistic fete came off in the presence of
the Emperor of Russia, Platoff, Blucher, etc. The display so delighted those
illustrious fighting men that it was resolved to carry the thing out on a
grander scale; accordingly, the King of Prussia, the Prince Royal, Prince
of Mecklenburg, and others assembled. Jackson, Cribb, Belcher, Oliver,
Painter, and Richmond, were the principal performers. The foreign nobility
now wanted a peep, and at Angelo’s rooms some splendid displays took place.
It was said that Jackson had inoculated them with a pugilistic fever, but it
is believed he never obtained a single pupil from among them. If this be a
fact, it is an extraordinary one.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the coronation of George the Fourth, 1821, Mr. Jackson was applied to
to furnish an unarmed force “to preserve order.” Cribb, Spring, Belcher,
Carter, Richmond, Ben Burn, Harmer, Harry Lee, Tom Owen, Joshua Hudson,
Tom Oliver, Harry Holt, Crawley, Curtis, Medley, Purcell, Sampson,
and Eales, with Jackson at their head, formed the corps, dressed as Royal
Pages.</p>

<p class='c007'>One gold coronation medal was given to the boxers—they raffled for it at
a dinner. Tom Belcher won and wore it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1822, a number of noblemen and gentlemen, admirers of the gymnastic
sports of their country, with a Royal Duke (Clarence) at their head,
presented John Jackson with a service of plate. The salver, which bears the
subjoined inscription, is of magnificent workmanship, weighing one hundred
and eighty-seven ounces.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Mr. Jackson had for many years been stakeholder, frequently referee, and
was always ready to go round personally to solicit a subscription for the beaten
man—and who could refuse John Jackson? A match was made in 1822,
between Randall and Martin for 500 guineas a side, but Mr. Elliot, Martin’s
backer, “cried for his toy again,” in fact, demanded his money back.
Mr. Jackson declared he would never again be a stakeholder, and he kept
his word. Thus virtually he retired from the ring, and from that moment
the ring declined. Its progress downwards has been checked, now and then,
by men of good conduct, and battles of great interest. Spring and Langan
(1824) revived the hopes of many. Dutch Sam from 1827 to 1839, rallied
a few of the right sort around him, so did Burn and Owen Swift. A sort of
reaction took place when Broome fought Bungaree; another, when Caunt
fought Bendigo; again on the occasion of the great resultless battle of Farnborough
between Sayers and Heenan in 1861; and lastly, the Benicia Boy’s
pulley-hauley match with Tom King, awakened attention; but down, down,
down, the ring was doomed to go, and in 1879 we may safely say that in writing
its later history we have penned its epitaph. The management of fights fell
into the hands of Jew speculators in special railway trains, whose interest it
became <em>not</em> to allow the announced battle to come off, and to repeat the process
of plunder in the shape of extortionately charged “excursion tickets,” at one
to three pounds each, until the fraud would no longer be submitted to.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c009'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>John Jackson lived for many years at the house in which he died, No. 4,
Lower Grosvenor Street West. The Old “Tattersall’s” may be said to have
divided his residence from that of another great artist, the late John Liston.
“It is with pleasing melancholy we remember,” says his old friend Vincent
Dowling, “the Yarmouths, the Coombes, the Lades, the Ashtons, wending
their way to the house of the one, while the Kembles, with perhaps Charles
Mathews and Charles Taylor, Theodore Hook and Young, were standing
in converse near, or visiting the low-roofed house of the latter.”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c009'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is little more to say. Loved by many, respected by all, enjoying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>a large circle of excellent society, John Jackson passed his later days.
Affluent, but not rich in the vulgar sense, he wanted less than he had,
and his income exceeded his expenditure. He was a cheerful companion,
sang a good song, told his anecdotes with great tact, and never obtruded
them. For the last year or two before his death his health declined, but
until then he rarely had a day’s illness. Peacefully and trustfully, with his
hand in that of his niece (whom he loved, and had assisted as a daughter),
John Jackson expired on the 7th of October, 1845, in the seventy-seventh
year of his age. His death was as calm and resigned as his life had been
exemplary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remains of John Jackson rest in Brompton Cemetery, beneath a handsome
monument, by Mr. Thomas Butler, of which we give a faithful representation.
On the side of the mausoleum nearest to the entrance is inscribed
on each side of a medallion portrait of the deceased:—</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c016'>BILL HOOPER (THE TINMAN)—1789‒1797.</h4>

<p class='c013'>As a foil to the bright memoir of a high-minded, self-respecting, and
honoured athlete, we cannot better “point a moral” than by devoting a
brief chapter to the sudden rise and inglorious fall of the “lion-hearted”
boxer, known in the latter part of his career as “Bully Hooper;” his story
is a beacon of warning to the successful pugilist in the day of his patronage,
prosperity, and success.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Hooper was born at Bristol in 1766, and previously to his unfortunate
connexion with the notorious Lord Barrymore, followed his trade as a
tinman in Tottenham Court Road, where he had the character of a smart,
industrious, well-behaved young man. His qualifications as a pugilist were
undoubted. Fear formed no part of his composition. His confidence was
innate; and neither the size nor strength of his antagonist deterred him any
more than a thorough-bred bull-dog would calculate the bulk of his unwieldy
bovine foe. Transplanted from making saucepans to the festivities of Wargrave,
and made the personal companion of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roué</span></i> nobleman, he lost his head,
as many better nurtured men than poor Hooper have done. The transition
from narrow means and humble station made him insolent, overbearing, and
ostentatious, and finally the petted pugilist sunk into the ferocious “bully,”
thence from dissipation and violent excess into a shattered human wreck, his
melancholy end marked by poverty, desertion, and disease.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c009'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>In person Hooper was compact and symmetrical. His shoulders and arms
were fine, his chest deep and broad; his height under five feet eight inches,
giving him the weight of 11 stone, showing him to have been nowhere
overloaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>He is said to have fought “a number of good battles,” of which we have
no evidence, save Pierce Egan’s assertion, to set against the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per contra</span></i> of a
contemporary, that he had “fought but twice before he met Lord Barrymore’s
man.” We suspect, however, an incidental trace of our hero to lurk
in the following paragraph at the end of the account of the great battle
between Tom Johnson and Ryan, at Cashiobury Park (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, page 59).</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two other battles were likewise fought on the 11th of February, 1789,
on the same stage. The first between Solly Sodicky, the Jew, and Wilson,
in which the Jew beat. The second was between the Welchman and <em>a
Tinman</em>, in which the former was cleverly defeated.” Be this as it may, on
the 19th of August, 1789, Hooper was matched with a local celebrity, Bill
Clarke, the plasterer, and the affair came off in Bloomsbury Fields, a plot
now covered with streets and squares, adjacent to Tottenham Court Road,
where Hooper exercised his vocation of a tinman. The battle was obstinately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>contested, Clarke being a powerful man, but the intuitive skill, activity, and
courage of Hooper carried him through, and his fame as a boxer spread.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cotterel, the shoemaker, challenged Hooper for 10 guineas a side, and they
met on Barnet Common, September 5th, 1789. There was a numerous
assemblage, for Hooper was looked upon as something surprising, and was
seconded by Tom Johnson, the Champion, while Bill Warr picked up Cotterel.
Thirty-five minutes’ desperate fighting on the part of Cotterel led to his utter
defeat, and Hooper, little the worse for the conflict, was proclaimed the
conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>A carpenter at Binfield Heath, of the name of Wright, having acquired
much fame in Berkshire for his fistic skill, was proposed by Lord Falkland
as a competitor for the Tinman, and Lord Barrymore, who had witnessed
Hooper’s prowess, at once accepted the cartel on Hooper’s behalf, naming his
own seat of Wargrave as the place of battle. Whatever might have been
Wright’s pretensions among the yokels, he made a poor figure before Hooper,
who fought with such skill and rapidity at his opponent’s head, that in
twenty minutes Wright<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c009'><sup>[66]</sup></a> was all wrong, and so punished as to be compelled
to give in. This battle took place December 3, 1789.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bob Watson, of Bristol, whom we shall have occasion to mention elsewhere
(see <span class='sc'>Watson</span>, Appendix to Period II.), was next introduced as an
antagonist for Hooper. This proved a most remarkable battle. The place
was Langley Close, near Salt Hill, in the neighbourhood of Windsor, and the
day February 17th, 1790. Bill Warr seconded, and Joe Ward was bottleholder
to Watson; Hooper was waited on by Tom Johnson and Butcher.
Major Churchill and Colonel Harvey Aston acted as umpires, but called in a
referee, owing to several differences of opinion during the prolonged contest.
In the third round the Tinman cleverly floored his opponent, being the first
knock-down blow; and this success he repeated in the three following rounds:
the odds were now high in favour of Hooper, and continued to increase as
the battle went on. Watson, though he could not ward off Hooper’s attacks,
proved thorough game, and rallied strongly at the close of each bout. Two
hours and a half, and one hundred rounds were fought, not without several
appeals as to Watson’s style of delivering a blow and falling, and other unfair
practices. Finally, after Watson had been “seven times accused of striking
unfairly,” Hooper was acknowledged the victor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Barrymore’s increasing folly now led to Hooper being matched with
Brain (Big Ben). This mockery of boxing took place at Chapel Row Revel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>near Newbury, Berks, August 30th, 1790; night coming on, after three hours
and a half harlequinade by Hooper, it was declared “a drawn battle!”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c009'><sup>[67]</sup></a>
(See <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 67).</p>

<p class='c007'>This exhibition much tarnished the fame of Hooper, who was now the
boon companion of the depraved Lord Barrymore’s excesses, and for more
than two years he did not appear within the ropes, save in the capacity of a
second. As on one of these occasions we find him officiating for Bill Treadway
in a combat which brings under our notice the earliest record of a black
pugilist, we preserve the paragraph as we find it, under the date of—</p>

<p class='c007'>“June 13th, 1791. A pitched match was contested in Marylebone Fields,
between an excellent African pugilist and the well-known Treadway. Peter
Bath seconded the Black, and Hooper, the Tinman, his antagonist. The
battle lasted thirty-five minutes, when Treadway was carried senseless from
the field. During the combat the African showed great agility, excellent
bottom, and a thorough knowledge of the art, not to be exceeded by the
most skilful among the boxers.” This black diamond’s name is not preserved.</p>

<p class='c007'>In September, 1792 an announcement appeared in the <cite>Chelmsford Advertiser</cite>
that two pugilistic contests would take place at Colchester on the 4th of
that month. “The grand jury who were at that time sitting, addressed the
mayor, recorder, and magistrates, expressing their wish that they might not be
permitted within the corporate jurisdiction. The mayor accordingly, by the
public wish, forbad the erection of any public stage or any prize fight within
the limits of his jurisdiction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of this notice, “orders were given for the erection of a
stage eighteen feet square at Bentley, about nine miles from Colchester.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On Thursday, September 4, 1792, the men met, according to arrangement,
and at four o’clock the first two combatants, Hooper, the Tinman, and
Bunner of Colchester, mounted the stage. Tom Johnson seconded Hooper,
with Sharp as bottle-holder. Bunner’s second was Williams, and his bottle-holder
Johnson’s old opponent Ryan. The stakes were 50 guineas a side.
Bunner, who was a young fellow of great strength and resolution, began so
vigorously that he bored down Hooper, and in the second round closing upon
him, brought him down heavily. The odds went up on Bunner, and the
Essex men were triumphant. Hooper found it would not do to trifle with
his opponent: he kept out, and displayed his superiority in the art
in great style, punishing his man sharply. In the sixth round, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Bunner fell by an overreach, and broke his right arm, thus giving Hooper an
easy conquest.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c009'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>George Maddox,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c009'><sup>[69]</sup></a> whose battle with the young Tom Cribb, has preserved
his name and memory, next challenged Hooper. They met for a stake of
50 guineas, at Sydenham Common, Kent, Monday, February 10, 1794. Tom
Johnson once more seconded Hooper; Maddox was attended by Joe Ward
and Bill Gibbons, the renowned of Westminster, as his bottle-holder. George
had proved himself a good man, and great expectations were entertained of
his ability to dispose of Hooper, who was much the lighter man. Betting
was five to four on Maddox. The Duke of Hamilton and a number of the
aristocratic patrons of pugilism were present. For the first three or four
rounds Maddox appeared to have the lead, and his friends were confident.
Hooper, however, met him with undaunted courage, hitting straight, and
putting in his blows with cutting severity. After three quarters of an hour’s
sharp fighting, Maddox fell off, while Hooper increased in activity, and at
the end of fifty-five minutes, Maddox gave in with much reluctance, and the
Tinman was hailed the victor.</p>

<p class='c007'>So high had Hooper’s fame now risen that a match was made by his
backer in March, 1794, for him to fight the renowned Dan Mendoza on
a twenty-four foot stage, for 50 guineas within a month. Dan, however,
was not to be had at such a bargain. The Israelite preferred forfeiting his
friends’ £20 deposit to risking his reputation on such terms.</p>

<p class='c007'>That determined boxer, Bill Wood<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c009'><sup>[70]</sup></a> was anxious to try his abilities with
our hero. His friends assisted him with £50, and on Monday, June 22nd,
1795, they met and fought upon a stage erected on Hounslow Heath, in the
dangerous vicinity of the powder mills. At two o’clock the combatants set-to.
The contemporary accounts describe it as “a truly desperate battle.” After
the first few minutes, the odds rose five to one, ten to one, and twenty to one
on Wood. After fighting twenty-five minutes, during which the punishment
was heavy, Hooper levelled Wood with a stupefying blow under the left ear.
From this time Wood, though he struggled gallantly, never entirely recovered,
and the blow being repeated, at the end of forty-eight minutes<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c009'><sup>[71]</sup></a> Hooper was
victorious. Towards the close of the fight the odds had changed to twenty to
one on the Tinman. “The Duke of Hamilton, Colonel Hamilton, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>distinguished party of amateurs were present,” says the chronicler of the
day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hooper had now arrived at the summit of his success by the conquest of
so game and experienced a pugilist as Wood. His time had come to tread
the downward path that leads to the cold shade of poverty, disgrace, and
neglect. Within one year of his conquest of Wood his excesses and riot
began to tell on a constitution shaken by hard living, night-riot, and
debauchery, and Tom Owen,<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c009'><sup>[72]</sup></a> a powerful young fellow, then known as “the
Fighting Oilman,” having been quarrelled with by Hooper, professed his
desire for a fight with “the Bully,” as he was now generally called.
Charley Coant, then a boxer of some note, forming a high opinion of Tom,
introduced him to Mr. John Jackson, and that good judge, approving the
new candidate for the honours of the P. R., obtained friends for “the
Young Oilman,” and a match was made for 100 guineas, which came off at
Harrow on the 14th of November, 1796. Owen proved himself a resolute
and steady fighter, and in the words of the reporter, “constantly kept a
straight guard of such prodigious strength that Hooper could never beat it
down, and very seldom put in a hit. Hooper, in striking a blow, dislocated
his shoulder, and being dreadfully bruised, gave in” after fifty rounds of
hard fighting. (See Life of <span class='sc'>Tom Owen</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>, p. 110). As we have already
said, Hooper was but a shadow of his former self; luxury and debauchery
had spoiled him.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c009'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Few men are more obnoxious to the smiles and frowns of fickle fortune
than the pugilist: victory brings him fame, riches, and patrons; his bruises
are unheeded in the smiles of success; and, basking in the sunshine of prosperity,
his life passes pleasantly, till defeat comes, and reverses the scene.
Covered with aches and pains, distressed in mind and body, assailed by
poverty, wretchedness, and misery, friends forsake him—his fame waxes dim—his
character is suspected by the losers; no longer the “plaything of
fashion,” he flies to inebriation for relief, and a premature death puts a period
to his misfortunes. Thus it was with Hooper: sheltered under the wings of
nobility, he became pampered, insolent, and mischievous. His courage was
undoubted, and though his frame was but small, it contained the heart of a
lion; big men struck no terror to his feelings, and he opposed them with all
the hardihood of an equal competitor, determined to conquer. Lord Barrymore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>as already noted, was fond of larking and practical jokes, and whenever
he could not come through the piece in style, Hooper appeared as his
bully—his name overawed, and many a time saved his patron a deserved
thrashing. One evening his Lordship took Hooper to Vauxhall, “disguised in
liquor,” yet farther disguised in band and cassock, as a clergyman. The visitors
discovered “the bully and his patron,” and after some rough handling, they
were summarily expelled from what Old Simpson, the M. C., grandiloquently
termed “the Royal Property.” At length his lordship cast him off, which,
as he had cast himself away before, is not surprising. Hooper soon afterwards
became wretched, disease overtook him, repeated intoxication brought
him to the brink of the grave. One evening he was found insensible on the
step of a door in St. Giles’s, and conveyed to the watch-house; on enquiring
who he was, he could but faintly articulate, “Hoop—Hoop—.” Being
recognised as the miserable remnant of that once powerful pugilistic hero, he
was humanely taken to the workhouse, where he immediately expired!—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic

<h4 class='c016'>TOM OWEN—1796‒1799 (1820).<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c009'><sup>[74]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c013'>Tom Owen, though living only in the memory of the present generation as
a landlord combining liquor and literature, some fancy, more fun, a certain
amount of old-school pugilism and much pretence, deserves a niche in this
period of the History of British Boxing.</p>

<p class='c007'>True it is the clumsy bespattering of praise with which, in bad English
and worst taste, his name is loaded in “Boxiana,” may induce many of better
judgment to turn from his biography; yet is there enough to furnish matter
worthy the pen of the chronicler of deeds of courage and of skill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Owen was a native of Hampshire, being born at Portsea, on the 21st
December, 1768.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the apocryphal rigmaroles which disfigure “Boxiana,” we shall not
condescend to take any account; suffice it to say, that after several provincial
encounters with the Smiths, Joneses, Greens, and Browns of his vicinity,
Tom Owen came to London, where he followed the occupation of an oilman;
a calling which the reader will perhaps condescend to remember was much
more followed than now; for, as Byron says, “in those days we had not got
to gas.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A casual turn up caused an introduction to Mr. Jackson, who, perceiving
the germ of future greatness in Tom, took him in hand, and, fancying his
style, he was matched against the then celebrated Bully Hooper, for 100
guineas.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 14th, Nov., 1796, Owen met his formidable antagonist, who, it must
be remembered (with the exception of his draw with Big Ben) was as yet
unconquered. The battle-field was near Harrow. Owen was seconded by
Joe Ward and Jack Bartholomew, Hooper by Symonds and Paddington Jones.
“The contest,” says the reporter, “lasted rather more than an hour, during
which the men fought fifty rounds of hard fighting, but for the most part of
which Owen constantly kept a straight guard of such prodigious strength,
that Hooper could never beat it down, and very seldom put in a hit. Hooper,
in striking a blow, dislocated his shoulder, and being also dreadfully bruised,
gave in. Owen was so little hurt, that he leisurely put on his clothes and
walked away.”</p>

<p>TOM OWEN, 1820.<br /><br /><em>From a Portrait by</em> <span class='sc'>George Sharples</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Pierce Egan tells us of a second fight (Hooper not being satisfied) for
100 guineas, at the same place (Harrow), a few weeks afterwards, which
“Owen won in equally good style.” We fail to find it in contemporary
records, though Pierce adds, “the stakeholder had his pocket picked of the
100 guineas, and Owen never got a single farthing afterwards,” vol. ii., p. 194.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fame of Owen now spread, and a match for 25 guineas a-side was
made between Jack Bartholomew and Tom, which took place at Moulsey
Hurst, August 22, 1797. George Maddox and Goff seconded Owen upon
this occasion. It was a desperate battle, and highly spoken of at the time,
for the courage displayed on both sides; but here Tom was forced to succumb;
Bartholomew overfought him, both at close quarters and out-fighting,
and the contest was finished by Owen being hit out of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>On September 2, 1799, Tom entered the lists with one Houssa, a Jew, for
10 guineas a-side, on the race-ground at Enfield. Joe Ward was second to
Owen. But here again Owen was so desperately beaten, that, after a struggle
of forty minutes, he was incapable of coming to the scratch, and the Jew was
the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>Davis, of Deptford, an excavator, weighing fourteen stone, was beaten by
Owen in one hour, at Deptford, in December, 1799.</p>

<p class='c007'>At a benefit which took place at the Horse-shoe and Hoop, Tower Hill,
Owen and Jack Bartholomew had some words about their fight at Moulsey.
The result was an exchange of blows. Pierce Egan tells us, “the smiles of
victory crowned the exertions of Owen in a quarter of an hour.” Perhaps so—but
old Tom was his own reporter.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the Surrey Sessions, in January, 1805, Owen was indicted for a riot
and conspiracy, on Putney Common, in aiding and abetting Joe Berks and
Pearce to fight a pitched battle. The jury found Owen guilty, and he was
sentenced to three months’ imprisonment in Horsemonger Lane.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this period Tom figured as a trainer and second, and his judgment
was generally considered good in all matters pugilistic; he also flourishes
immensely in the benefit-taking line, and was, as the “Historian” terms him,
“fly to every movement on the board.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall decline transferring the trash of the Apocrypha of Boxing
respecting the exploits of Owen, as no traces of them are to be found in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“canonical books,”—which, we take to be the journals of the time. Leaving
him, therefore, as a blind guide, we proceed to the contest with Mendoza.
This, although a very foolish affair on the part of the Jew, as the follies of
great men, even in pugilism, outweigh in interest the wiser doings of lesser
ones, is our chief reason for giving Owen a separate chapter in the history of
pugilism—despite the immense, intense, and absurd gaggery of his injudicious
friend and biographer.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1820, Tom (being no bad judge at match-making) proposed to Daniel
Mendoza a “passage at arms” to settle an old grudge. Dan, like an old
war-horse at the sound of the trumpet, though physically but a shadow of
his former self, met the twelve stone Tom Owen. Thirty-three years had
elapsed since the “Star of the East” had first peeled in the lists, and fourteen
since his last appearance. Although, however, his deeds were, even to
the existing generation of ring-goers, rather matter of tradition than evidence,
the fame of Mendoza made him the favourite at six and five to four. Owen
was known to be a good man, but it was thought he had not science enough
to oppose the accomplished Israelite. Hence a great number of the oldest
amateurs were induced to be present. It is worthy of note, that Sir Thomas
Apreece, Bart., who was Mendoza’s umpire at Odiham, acted in that capacity
on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Owen, attended by Cribb and Josh. Hudson, threw up his hat first; and
Mendoza, followed by Randall and Harry Lee, repeated the token of defiance.
Mendoza was loudly cheered, and backed at five to four. Mendoza was quickly
ready, and walked about the ring with a coat thrown over him. Owen was
a considerable time preparing himself, and in making his shoes right; instead
of drawers he fought in a pair of nankeen breeches. Mendoza’s colours were
a blue silk bird’s eye, and tied over Owen’s.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Mendoza, on stripping, exhibited
a fine manly bust; his eyes sparkled
with confidence, and there was altogether an
appearance about him that seldom characterises
an individual of fifty-five years of age.
Owen, on the contrary, looked thin; and his
general appearance was rather meagre than
otherwise. On setting-to, both the ould
ones were extremely cautious, and a minute
elapsed before a hit was made. Owen at
length let fly, but without any effect. Some
exchanges took place, when they closed at
the ropes, and, after an attempt to fib on the
part of Mendoza, which was frustrated by
Owen, a struggle for throw ensued: in going
down, Dan was the undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Mendoza ran in with great alacrity,
made a sort of push forward, and got Owen
on the ropes; the latter went down, and his
neck got scored from them. (Great applause
for Mendoza. While Tom was on the knee
of Josh, the latter said, “Master!”—Owen,
smiling, “What says my boy?”—“Have
you brought the pepper castor with you?—“Yes,
my lad, and the mustard and vinegar
cruet too!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The Jew behaved very handsomely,
and showed some good fighting; but Owen
planted a tremendous hit on his left cheek,
just under the eye, whence the claret flowed
copiously: Mendoza went down, yet jumped
up gaily. (Randall told Mendoza he should
not have done so. “Let these ould ones
alone,” said Josh; “they know more about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>fighting than you or I do.” Even betting,
but Owen for choice. “I say, master,” says
Josh, “you furnished Danny with some sour
crout then!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Owen now showed the spectators that
he was the younger man. Mendoza was
again nobbed, and the claret profusely running
down his cheek. In going down Owen
was undermost. (“When am I to have the
tobacco-stopper, master?” cries Josh.—“Leave
it all to the cook yet!” Owen smilingly
observed.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Mendoza now showed he was completely
gone by as to any superiority of fighting.
Owen, having nothing to oppose him,
“displayed talents that astonished the ring.”
Mendoza received a dreadful fall.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Owen, in retreating from his antagonist,
ran against the stakes, but the latter
again planted a heavy facer. In struggling,
both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Here Tom was the hero of the tale.
He nobbed Mendoza, and got away with all
the dexterity of a youth: it was now only
Mendoza by name; his excellence as a
fighter had evaporated, and his hits were
generally short. Owen, in a close at the
ropes, held Mendoza as firm as if the latter
had been screwed in a vice, and pummelled
him at the back of the neck so dreadfully,
that Dan at length fell exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Mendoza came to the scratch bleeding,
and almost in a state of stupor, from
the severity of the last round. Owen planted
such a tremendous hit on Dan’s face, that he
went back, and slipped down at the corner
of the ring. The Jews were still backing
Mendoza with confidence.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Long sparring: Owen convinced the
spectators that he was a perfect master of
the art. He hit Mendoza in the eye, jobbed
him also in the face, and at the end of the
ropes held Mendoza by the arm, and punished
him till he went down. (Two to one on Owen.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—The appearance of Mendoza’s face
was much changed; his left eye was encircled
in claret. Owen got away from his antagonist
in good style. Mendoza was punished
all over the ring; Owen threw his opponent,
and fell heavily upon him. (Three to one.
Indeed, it was any odds.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Owen was determined not to give a
chance away; and he also appeared determined
not to have any more body blows.
He accordingly kept at out-fighting. A
short but sharp rally occurred, when Owen
fell; and Mendoza likewise, at about two
yards distance, came heavily down upon his
face on the turf.</p>

<p class='c022'>12th and last.—Mendoza was quite abroad,
and hit short, and at the ropes was again
held by Owen, and fibbed down. Mendoza
said he would not fight any more, as he
could not win it. He was terribly punished,
and defeated in fourteen minutes and twenty-seven
seconds and a quarter; while, on the
contrary, Owen had not a scratch on his
face. The latter was carried out of the ring
by Cribb and Hudson, amidst the cheers of
the spectators.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mendoza, while being dressed, seemed sensibly affected at his defeat. He
had not the least idea of losing the battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Jackson collected £20 on the ground for Mendoza, who was put into
a coach. Owen soon returned to the ring, decorated in the spoils attendant
upon conquest. Mendoza’s blue trophy was hung round Owen’s neck, surmounted
by the yellow-man of Hooper; now doubly won.</p>

<p class='c007'>This battle hardly deserves comment, after the observations we have
already made under the memoir of Mendoza; yet it is valuable as a warning.
The merits of the combatants remain, except in the balderdash of “the
historian” of the P. R., just where they stood previous to the fight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom’s judgment as a second was unquestionable. His coolness and readiness
as second to Turner in his victory over Scroggins, and in the remarkable
fight with Sutton and Painter, may be cited.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom was known for many years as a pleasant companion, a good convivial
singer, and the landlord of a house on the ground now occupied by the basin
of St. Katherine’s Docks, whence the hand of improvement compelled him to
migrate. For several years he was well known as the landlord of the Shipwrights’
Arms at Northfleet, where the fancy of all grades found him a civil,
pleasant, and obliging host. Owen died at Plumstead in 1843 aged 76 years.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>TOM JONES (KNOWN AS “PADDINGTON JONES”).—1786‒1805.</h4>

<p class='c013'>This well-remembered pugilist, whose career forms a link between the
Second and Third Periods of the History of the Ring, well deserves a chapter,
from his numerous and game contests, his attentive civility during his protracted
connexion with fistic affairs, and yet more from his identification
with the renowned Jem Belcher, for whose first metropolitan competitor he
had the honour to be selected. Tom, including his numerous “outside” or
“bye-battles,” is supposed to have fought more battles than any other
pugilist. The Ring in Hyde Park was the frequent arena of his contests,
which in his noviciate were chiefly with roughs and commoners.</p>

<p class='c007'>About the year 1766, Paddington gave birth to this hero, from which
place he derived his pugilistic title. Tom commenced boxer when quite
a youth, and, from the intuitive science which he displayed at that early
period, attracted the notice of the veteran Tom Johnson, who pronounced
him to be a promising pugilist. Jones’s weight was ten stone and a half, his
height five feet eight inches, and his frame of much symmetry and activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom’s first regular contest was about the year 1786, with one Jack Holmes,
in Harley Fields, near where Cavendish Square stands, for the important
sum of <em>half-a-crown</em>, and it appears it was as well-contested as if £100 had
been the stakes; but Jones being a mere novice, and quite a stripling, and
Holmes a full grown man, the latter proved the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>A match was made between a one-eyed sailor, a most determined boxer,
and Tom Jones, for 10 guineas a-side, in February, 1786, which was decided
in the Ring, in Hyde Park. The contest proved a desperate one. The Sailor
was considered as ugly a customer as ever stood up for a mill; but, in the
event, Jones was declared victor. This hardy son of Neptune was not
satisfied with the first broadside, and soon afterwards entered the lists for
another 10 guineas, when he was again vanquished; yet, like a perfect true
blue, he was valiant enough to endure a third engagement, in which he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>also beaten. The Sailor displayed great bottom, and was punished severely
before he gave in.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of the twelvemonth, however, smarting under the recollection
of defeat, Tom challenged Jack Holmes to a second trial (half-minute time),
for a guinea and a half, when Jones obtained an easy conquest. This was on
the 19th of December, 1786.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aldridge, the Life-guardsman, who had been vaunting of his great deeds
of pugilism at Tom Johnson’s house, near Lincoln’s Inn Fields, was told by
Joe Ward that he would produce a boy who should soon take the conceit out
of him: accordingly, a match was made for two guineas against a watch, and
Paddington Jones was brought forward as the man to accept the challenge.
It was to have been decided in the street, in the first instance, but was
removed to Harley Fields. On stripping, the guardsman smiled with contempt
at his boy-like antagonist, and, from his long arms, had the advantage
at the first part of the battle, dealing out some sharp punishment; but the
science and bottom of Tom soon stopped his career. After a most desperate
conflict, which was witnessed by most of the celebrated pugilists of that day,
who were astonished at the intrepidity displayed by Jones, the “<em>boy</em>”
succeeded in milling his opponent in sixty rounds. Joe Ward seconded
Jones.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after the above circumstance, in the same fields, Jones fought one
Jack Blackwell, a lime-burner, for 10 shillings; and, although the latter
showed complete ruffianism in the battle, he was easily disposed of by Tom.
Tom Burley, a companion of Blackwell, thought he could now vanquish
Jones, and had the temerity to enter the ring, immediately on the fight
being over, and challenged him for the like sum. Tom instantly accepted the
cartel. Burley was also a complete ruffian, and tried what downright force
could effect; but Jones so completely foiled his attacks, and returned blows
with so much science and effect, that Burley was perfectly satisfied. These
contests were rendered somewhat conspicuous from the celebrated Major
Hanger (afterwards Lord Coleraine) and his black servant performing the
office of second and bottle-holder to Jones.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c009'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On May 14, 1792, immediately after the fight of Mendoza and Bill Warr,
at Smitham Bottom, near Croydon, upon the same stage, Jones fought Caleb
Baldwin. The battle was for a purse of £20, but a dispute arising between
the parties, although Caleb claimed the victory, it was declared a drawn
battle.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Soon after the above contest, Jones entered the ring in Hyde Park, with
Dick Horton, a baker, for 20 guineas. The latter was considered to have
some pretensions to pugilism; but Jones dealt out his hits so hard and fast,
that the baker was glad to cry enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jones, in company with Pardo Wilson, anxious to witness the fight
between Hooper and Bunner, at Bentley Green (September 4, 1792) walked
down to Colchester, and was extremely stiff from the effects of his journey.
The following day, a man of the name of Abraham Challice, standing six feet
high, and weighing fourteen stone (a perfect terror to the inhabitants of that
part of the country from his great strength), observing Tom Jones upon the
race-ground, and to show his dexterity, out of mere wantonness, endeavoured
to trip up Jones’s heels, and otherwise insulted him, also threatening to give
him a good hiding. Tom, notwithstanding the great disparity between them,
was not to be insulted with impunity, and, perhaps with more pluck than
prudence, instantly showed fight. Challice laughed at him with the most
sovereign contempt, bidding him get along for “a boy,” or he would kick his
breech for his impudence. The spectators were alarmed at the youthful
appearance of Jones, who weighed but ten stone five pounds, and begged of
him to desist, as the consequences might prove of the most serious nature;
but Tom was not to be deterred, and soon pulled off his clothes. Upon
setting-to, Challice had the advantage from his superior strength, and kept it
for three rounds; but in the fourth, Jones put in a hit under Challice’s ear,
that knocked him down, when Tom Johnson offered to back Jones for £100.
Challice, on standing up, appeared much confused, and Tom served him out
in the same style, and continued punishing him every round till he could
scarcely move, and he soon acknowledged he had never received such a
complete milling before. The farmers and others who witnessed the contest
were so pleased that this insolent fellow, who had rendered himself so disgusting
about that neighbourhood, had received a good thrashing, immediately
made a subscription purse, which soon amounted to 30 guineas, and
presented it to Jones for his bravery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day a countryman, well known in the neighbourhood of Bentley
Green under the name of “Leather Jacket,” mounted the stage, and, with
considerable vaunting, publicly challenged any Londoner to enter the lists
with him. The words had scarcely escaped from his lips, when up jumped
Tom, without any consideration for his hands, which were bruised from the
effects of the severe punishment he had bestowed upon the nob of Abraham
Challice the preceding day, and instantly began to prepare for action. The
countryman seemed thunderstruck with astonishment, and with faltering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>speech exclaimed, “Na! na! you be the man that beat Ab. Challice yesterday—I
mean ony one but thee!” and made a hasty retreat from the stage,
amid the laughter and sneers of the spectators at Leather Jacket’s vain
boasting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jones beat Keely Lyons, the Jew, at Blackheath, on the 10th of May,
1794, for a purse of 20 guineas. Tom Johnson was second to Jones. It was
a well-contested battle, in which much science and bottom were displayed on
both sides.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a second attempt on a stage at Hounslow, June 22, 1795, Jones disposed
of the same boxer in nine rounds, occupying sixteen minutes. Lyons
was a courageous pugilist, and a boxer above mediocrity.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the August of 1795 Jones was at Bristol, the pugilistic nursery, with
Tom Johnson and other celebrities: a match for a purse with Spaniard Harris
took place. After twenty minutes’ fighting, Harris, during a wrangle, got
hold of the purse, and bolted with it, leaving Jones and Co. “lamenting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the renowned Jem Belcher’s appearance in the metropolis as a pugilist,
Tom Jones was the man selected to have the trial set-to with him. This
came off at Old Oak Common, Wormwood Scrubs, on April 12, 1799.</p>

<p class='c007'>Belcher was seconded by Bill Warr, and Bill Gibbons acted as his bottle-holder.
Jones had for his attendants, Joe Ward and Dick Hall. Belcher
was, at this period, only nineteen years of age. The odds were six to four
upon Jem. The spectators were much interested upon the commencement of
the battle, from the very high character which had been promulgated by Bill
Warr, as to the astonishing abilities that his pupil possessed, and the feats
which he had achieved at Bristol. The first round, considerable science was
displayed upon both sides—the experience and skill of Jones were well
displayed; and the dexterity and new mode of fighting, so exclusively
Belcher’s own, were soon exhibited. On the termination of the first round
Belcher was knocked down. The advantages in the second and third rounds
were evenly balanced; but in the fourth and fifth Jones was levelled.
In the sixth and seventh rounds Jones showed off in most excellent style:
skill, manliness, and fortitude, no shifting, nothing shy, hugging out of the
question, and hauling not resorted to: it was a clean fight throughout,
stopping and hitting were the order of the day, and it might be deemed
a model for pugilists in general to follow. Belcher, with all the gaiety and
confidence of youth, now exhibited a new feature as a boxer. The odds had
changed five to four on Jones. The eighth and ninth were spiritedly
contested; but, in the tenth round, Belcher put in some tremendous hits,
with the rapidity of lightning. This immediately altered the appearance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>things, Jem was looked upon as the favourite, and the odds were laid
accordingly. Yet Jones nobly contested for victory for the space of thirty-three
minutes, before he gave in. Jem weighed twelve stone six pounds,
and Tom Jones but ten stone five pounds. It should not escape the memory,
that Jones stood up to Belcher (before that distinguished pugilist lost his
eye) considerably longer than any other man ever did.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1798 Jones was matched in London to fight George Nicholls (the conqueror
of Cribb). Mendoza and Johnson took Tom down to Lansdown, near
Bath, for that purpose; but upon the combatants stripping, and just as they
were about commencing the set-to, the following singular circumstance
occurred:—Nicholls cried out “Stop!” and observing that Jones was above
his height, declared he would not fight him, and, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans ceremonie</span></i>, immediately
left the ring, to the great astonishment and disappointment of the spectators.
After some years had elapsed, upon Nicholls arriving in London, a match was
made for 20 guineas, and they tried their skill at Norwood, in March, 1802.
Three rounds were well contested, and considerable science was displayed;
but in the fourth, Nicholls ran furiously in, and getting his head between
Jones’s legs, and catching fast hold of both his ankles, threw Tom with considerable
violence. This was deemed an infringement upon the rules of
pugilism by the friends of Jones: a considerable interruption was the consequence,
and the fight was at an end. The stakes were demanded on the part
of Jones; but Bill Warr, who seconded Nicholls, would not suffer them to
be given up. Respecting which was the best man, it was impossible to form
anything like a decision. Jones, on his road home, had a turn up with a
man of the name of Carter, who had insulted him about a challenge from
Simpson. Tom, who was not much hurt from the above contest, set-to with
good pluck, and so soon convinced Carter he was in the wrong, that he
sheered off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Isaac Bittoon, the Jew, had offered himself to Jones’s notice, when Jem
Belcher, who had beaten Jones, generously undertook to find him backers.
Forty guineas were put down, and they met on Wimbledon Common, July
13, 1801. Jem Belcher seconded Jones. It was a severely-contested fight, but
Bittoon was the heavier and stronger man, and although Tom displayed great
science and courage, he was unable to come to time (half-minute) at the end
of twenty-two minutes, being hit senseless.</p>

<p class='c007'>Simpson, a pupil of Tom Johnson’s, upon whom considerable expectations
had been raised, was matched against Jones for 10 guineas a-side, which
battle was decided on the Green, near Putney, in June 1804. It was termed
a good fight, and Tom proved the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>On August 6th, 1805, Tom Jones fought another Lyons, known as “the
Yokel Jew,” at Hounslow, for 10 guineas a-side. This was one of the most
terrible conflicts in which Tom had been engaged. Yokel was a desperate
punisher, and Jones suffered severely in the fight; nevertheless Yokel gave in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the numerous lists of battles which have been mentioned,
it does not appear that Paddington Jones ever made pugilism his peculiar
profession, but industriously followed through life his occupation, much
respected by his friends for his civility and good nature. Jones was a man
of mild and civil behaviour, and for a long series of years was well known
as master of the ceremonies at the Fives and Tennis Courts, as a second and
an attendant upon sparring exhibitions.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a pugilist, Jones is entitled to honourable mention; to a respectable
amount of skill he united game of the first quality. He turned out
several good pupils. His guard was good and his position ready, with his
left arm firm and extended to protect his body from assault, while his right
was on the alert to give the return. Tom was a hard hitter, used both his
hands with equal facility, stood well upon his legs, and met his man with
fortitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the evident disadvantages that Jones had to contend
against in his battle with Jem Belcher—the disparagement of having been
severely punished in numerous battles, and other hurts from skirmishes,
contrasted with Belcher who had scarcely been pinked, and was blooming
from the country—Tom’s conduct was far above mediocrity.</p>

<p class='c007'>No man appeared oftener in the character of a second than Tom Jones, and
few understood that duty better than himself. In most of Randall’s battles
Tom performed that office.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible that we can take our leave of Paddington Jones without
characterising him as a brave pugilist, and well deserving to occupy a niche
in the temple of fame as a straightforward, courageous, and deserving man.
Jones died at his birthplace, Paddington, August 22, 1833, at the age of 67.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>APPENDIX TO PERIOD II.</h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c016'>BILL WARR, OF BRISTOL—1787‒1792.</h4>

<p class='c013'>William Warr (incorrectly spelt Ward in many chronologies, etc.) was
one of the many boxers of the Bristol nursery. He was expressly brought
to London to lower the pretensions of Tom Johnson, with what success we
have already seen. He was five feet nine inches in height, strongly made,
with symmetrical breast and arms, robust in appearance, extremely active,
and altogether well framed for a pugilist. As a second, Will Warr figures in
numerous fights of his period, and was of acknowledged judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>After his defeat by Johnson, Warr’s next battle was with Wood, the
coachman, December 31, 1788, at Navestock, Essex. It snowed incessantly
during the combat, “yet,” says the report, “the ardour of the combatants
was not chilled, nor even the curiosity of the spectators damped. The snow,
however, did not fail to have its effects upon the battle; for the boards of the
stage being rendered extremely slippery, the pugilists were unable to keep
their feet, and each in his turn, as well in giving as receiving blows, was
brought to the ground. Warr fought in his usual style, with much clever
shifting, and displayed great agility and science. Considering this Wood’s
first essay, and against one of such experience in the pugilistic art, he showed
great courage and determination. He fought, however, with too much impetuosity,
and by this means exposed himself to the more deliberate defence
of his opponent. For the first twenty minutes the battle was most admirably
contested on both sides. In five minutes after setting-to Warr succeeded in
closing Wood’s right eye, yet he continued the fight for half an hour with
astonishing firmness, until Warr got some heavy hits in succession on the
other eye, when he was forced to yield the victory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His two defeats by Mendoza are reported in the memoir of that pugilist
(pp. 76, 77).</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 5th of May, 1789, as Bill Warr and Watson were going down to
Stilton to be present at the battle between Mendoza and Humphries, he met
with an unfortunate occurrence. A man of the name of Swaine, a smith, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>was an outside passenger of the same coach, having had some words with
Warr about the merits of Mendoza, challenged Warr to fight. Accordingly,
at the Bell Inn, Enfield, they turned out, when Warr struck him an unlucky
blow in the chest: Swaine fell and instantly expired. Warr was taken into
custody, and the following Sessions, at the Old Bailey, was convicted of
manslaughter. The whole tenour of the evidence went to show that Warr
tried everything short of cowardice to avoid the encounter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stanyard, of Birmingham, who had fought a draw with Andrew Gamble,
an Irishman (one of Pierce Egan’s Irish heroes, renowned for being beaten,
despite the most wondrous qualifications<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c009'><sup>[76]</sup></a>), was liberally backed against
Warr for 100 guineas, and they fought at Colnbrook, October 27, 1792. We
may observe that “the fight was fixed to take place at Langley Broom, but
was interrupted by the interference of the magistrates, and a move took
place to Colnbrook.” We give, as shall be our custom, a report instead of
an embellished paraphrase:—“A stage having been erected, at half-past two
Stanyard ascended, accompanied by Tom Johnson as his second, and Butcher
as his bottle-holder. Shortly afterwards Warr made his appearance, with
Watson for his second, and Joe Ward as his bottle-holder. Captain Halliday
and Mr. Sharp were chosen umpires. Mr. Harvey Aston, Lord Say and Sele,
Mr. Dashwood, Sir Thomas Apreece, Colonel Hamilton, Mr. Bedingfield, and
other distinguished persons were present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At forty-six minutes to two, the combatants being prepared, set-to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Warr acted on the defensive;
some minutes were lost in sparring, when
Stanyard put in a body blow, but without
much effect; they then exchanged several
blows, and Warr was knocked down.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Stanyard displayed superiority, and
Warr fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Warr gave his adversary a severe blow
on the right cheek, which broke his jaw at
the angle. It was generally allowed to be
the severest blow thrown in.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Notwithstanding this misfortune,
Stanyard stood, and never even complained
to his second. In this round Warr was
knocked down.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Warr was again knocked down, and at
the conclusion held up his open hand to
protect his face.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—In this round Stanyard displayed most
astonishing strength, for he fairly held Warr
up, struck him most severely, and threw
him down on the stage with astonishing
violence.</p>

<p class='c022'>7 and 8.—Both these rounds Stanyard terminated
by giving his antagonist a knock-down
blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Stanyard gave Warr a severe blow
under the right eye, and he again fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—This was the last and best round,
being the only one of any continuance, and
during which much hard fighting was displayed;
Warr gave his opponent four severe
blows on his broken jaw, and it finished by
both coming down.</p>

<p class='c022'>At the conclusion of this round, although
they had only fought thirteen minutes,
Stanyard gave in. His appearance was in
his favour, but no one had any idea of the
injury he had sustained. He was immediately
conveyed to Colnbrook, and medical
assistance procured, when it was found his
jawbone was fractured near the articulation.
Warr was in prime condition, and
never displayed greater skill and courage.
He challenged Tom Johnson to fight for a
guinea; an empty boast, as we have elsewhere
observed.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Will Warr, miscalculating his skill, sought another trial with the accomplished
Mendoza, who disposed of him in fifteen minutes (see <span class='sc'>Mendoza</span>).
Warr became a publican at the One Tun, Jermyn Street, in after life, and
seconded Jem Belcher, Tom Belcher, Henry Pearce (the Game Chicken),
Mendoza, Tom Cribb, and others in important battles. In December, 1808,
we find a benefit advertised at the Fives Court, for Warr, at which John
Gully, Tom Cribb, Dutch Sam, Dogherty, Tom Belcher, and Richmond,
set-to for the veteran. Warr died in March, 1809, and was buried in St.
James’s burial ground, St. Pancras.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WILL WOOD, THE COACHMAN—1788‒1804.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Bill Wood, although his defeats were preponderant, deserves honourable
mention at the hands of the historian of pugilism as one of the bravest and
hardiest of boxers. His opponents were the very best men of their day.
Bill Warr, George the brewer, whom he beat, Hooper the tinman, Jack
Bartholomew (beat), and Isaac Bittoon, were his antagonists. Wood was a
fine straight-limbed man of five feet eleven inches in height, and twelve stone
in weight. He fought well with both hands, and possessed unquestionable
courage. His style was impetuous, and his attack formidable to all but the
most skilful of defensive boxers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wood’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’essai</span></i> was at Navestock, Essex, as “Captain Robinson’s
coachman,” on the last day of the year 1788. Although looked upon as a
novice in the art pugilistic, he tried all the skill of Bill Warr before he
surrendered. (See Life of <span class='sc'>Warr</span>, <span class='sc'>Appendix</span>, p. 120).</p>

<p class='c007'>So well had our hero acquitted himself that George the brewer (Ingleston),
“renowned as a stand-up fighter,” who had, as we have seen, beaten John
Jackson, and Pickard (twice), having issued a challenge as Champion, it was
accepted by Wood. The stake was 100 guineas, and on the 13th of February,
1793, at Hornchurch, in Essex, the men met on a stage twenty-four feet
square. Wood was seconded by Joe Ward, while Dan Mendoza attended
upon Ingleston. At one o’clock, the combatants, fully prepared, mounted
the stage, and having shaken hands, set-to immediately. “In the first
round Wood knocked down his antagonist with great violence. George rose
immediately, and with inconsiderate impetuosity attacked his opponent.
Wood, taking advantage of his fury and want of caution, retreated, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>put in a tremendous blow on the point of the jaw, which broke it:
every spectator,” says the report in “Pancratia,” “heard the crush, and
immediately perceived the swelling consequent on the fracture. The battle
was supposed to be at an end, but George, with unsubdued courage, renewed
the attack, and in the rally dealt Wood a blow upon the head which almost
stunned him. The odds now rose to two to one in favour of George. However,
after twenty-five minutes of severe fighting, in which George received
many heavy blows about the head, he, being almost senseless, gave in.”
The reporter adds: “Wood was much beaten, but every one feared George
would pay the forfeit of his life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wood’s fame now stood so high, that in January, 1794, he was matched
with the renowned Ben Brain (Big Ben) the Champion. Ben was now
approaching his last illness, and a forfeit took place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our hero was not allowed to stand without a customer. Hooper was in
the height of his fame, having beaten Wright and Watson, made a draw with
Big Ben, and defeated Bunner and George Maddox. Yet Wood was thought
by many good enough to lower his pride. They met at Hounslow, June 22,
1794, as related in the memoir of Hooper (p. 107); and Wood was beaten,
but not ingloriously.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first month of 1797, we find Wood matched with the famous
Jack Bartholomew, who had just beaten Firby (the young Ruffian). See
<span class='sc'>Bartholomew</span>, Appendix to Period III. The battle came off between
Ealing and Harrow, on a stage, January 30th, 1797.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c009'><sup>[77]</sup></a> “At two o’clock the
men set-to; but the amateurs were sadly disappointed. Bartholomew was
sadly out of condition, and not only made no good defence against Wood’s
attacks, but shifted, and struck foul; repeating the offence at the end of
fifteen minutes, the battle was given in favour of Wood. The Duke of
Hamilton and other distinguished ring-patrons were present, and Wood told
his Grace he would fight Bartholomew again in a fortnight for £500, or
when he pleased, if the Duke would back him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wood, who was always a steady and industrious man, now retired for a
while, pursuing the then flourishing avocation of a hackney coachman, and
driving his own horses and lumbering leathern convenience. He often,
however, figures in the interval as second or bottle-holder in the battles of
the day. Isaac Bittoon, the Jew, having beaten Paddington Jones, and
fought a drawn battle with George Maddox, was anxious for a shy at Wood,
now a veteran in the field; the match was long talked about, but at length
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>arranged for the 16th of July, 1804, for a purse of 50 guineas and some bye
bets to be received by the winner. The magistrates were upon the alert, but
the secret of the chosen spot was well kept, Willesden Green being named as
the Campus Martius so late as the evening before the battle, which took
place as early as ten o’clock on the Monday morning. It would have been
well had the same secrecy and promptitude been practised in many more
recent fights, which have come to grief from the publicity given to their
probable whereabouts, and above all, from the abominable delays at the
ring side.</p>

<p class='c007'>The field at Willesden was early filled, and at three quarters past ten
the combatants entered “a roped-ring.” Wood immediately began to strip,
and appeared to be in robust condition. Bittoon followed in high spirits,
and after the usual ceremony, the men set-to. Wood was defeated in thirty-six
rounds, occupying fifty-six minutes; Wood, in the words of the contemporary
report, “being quite worn out.” (See <span class='sc'>Bittoon</span>, for the battle).</p>

<p class='c007'>This was Wood’s last appearance within the ropes. He was for many
years a well-known character among the Jehus at the West End. In May
of the year 1821, we find under the head of “Some Slight Sketches of Boxers,
who have retired from Public Contests, on account of Age or other Infirmities,”
the following: “Bill Wood, the coachman, once the formidable opponent of
Bill Warr, Bartholomew, George the Brewer, and Bittoon, enjoys a fine green
old age, and frequently takes a peep into the Fives Court to see the
young ’uns exhibit.” Wood died in St. Pancras, in January, 1839, aged 64.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>GEORGE INGLESTON, THE BREWER—1789‒1793.</h4>

<p class='c013'>George Ingleston, known as George the Brewer, was a powerful six-foot
man, of somewhat heavy build, undoubted courage, but, like many big ones,
fought slowly in comparison with lighter and more agile men. He was,
however, “acknowledged to be a tremendous hard hitter,” says “Pancratia.”
“He was first introduced to the notice of the amateurs by the celebrated
Tom Johnson,” says the same authority, “who tried to cultivate his
powers, but did not form any high opinion of his skill. His guard was low,
like his renowned master’s; he never shifted, but unflinchingly met the
coming blow, and trusted rather to a return than the quick and effective
method of a counter hit.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>We shall pass the earlier and unimportant battles of George the Brewer to
come to his most important contest, that with John Jackson, which came off
in presence of a distinguished company, in the yard of the Swan Inn, at
Ingatestone, in Essex, on the 12th of May, 1789. Brain (Big Ben) seconded
Jackson, Tom Tring (the Carlton House porter) attended upon Ingleston.</p>

<p class='c007'>On setting-to the betting was even, but the superior skill of Jackson was
evident in the first round, when after some skilful stops and parries, Jackson
at the close of the round brought down the brewer. In the second and third
rounds the skill and activity of Jackson brought the odds to seven to four in
his favour. In this round, owing to a heavy rain which had fallen in the
forenoon, the boards of the stage were extremely slippery, and in breaking
ground Jackson slipped, and fell with such violence that his ankle was
dislocated and the small-bone of his leg broken. There was no alternative
but surrender; although the report of the day states that Jackson “offered
to be fastened down to a chair (after the fashion of sailors on a chest in
their boxing matches), provided the Brewer would do the like, and thus
fight it out.” There was pluck at any rate in the proposition; but George,
who saw the stakes within grasp, was not so green as to let go “the bird in
hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 23rd of October, 1789, Ingleston met and defeated Pickard, called
“the Birmingham Champion.” The battle took place on a twenty-four foot
stage, at Banbury, in Oxfordshire. It is described in the report as a
desperate stand-up fight, in which, after thirty-four minutes of “fierce”
rallying, Pickard cried “enough!” and Ingleston was hailed the victor.
This was fought the day after the great battle of Johnson and Perrins. See
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, Life of <span class='sc'>Tom Johnson</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pickard was not, however, satisfied of his inferiority to George, and again
found friends to back him for 50 guineas against his old opponent. They
met at Shipston-upon-Stour, Staffordshire, September 25, 1791, when the
former decision was re-affirmed, and Pickard cleverly defeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ingleston’s last battle was with Bill Wood, the coachman, at Hornchurch,
for 100 guineas, February 13, 1793, which will be found under the pugilistic
doings of <span class='sc'>Wood</span> (p. 122). George Ingleston, on his retirement, resumed his
calling of a brewer, and was for years known as a civil and industrious man
in the neighbourhood of Enfield, where one of his old patrons, Captain
Brailsford, held a brewery of some extent.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>BOB WATSON, OF BRISTOL—1788‒1791.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Bristol, for more than half a century renowned for its pugilistic champions,
gave birth to Watson, a well-known man in the ring doings of the last
quarter of the eighteenth century. Watson was related by marriage to the
family of the Belchers, having married the sister of Jem and Tom Belcher,
while his daughter was the wife of the late Jem Burn (see vol. iii., life of
Burn). Watson was another sample of a large heart in a small body. His
height was no more than five feet five inches, his weight nine stone two
pounds, yet by courage and science, Bob went far to compensate these deficiencies.
After many provincial victories, Watson entered the ring, after the
victory of Jackson over Fewterel (June 9, 1788), at Croydon, in presence of
the Prince of Wales and a distinguished company. His opponent was Elisha
Crabbe, an Israelite, who had won fame by defeating old Stephen Oliver,
known as “Death.” “This,” says the reporter, “was by far the best battle
of the three, and lasted three quarters of an hour. Warr seconded Watson;
Ryan (the opponent of the champion) attended upon Crabbe. Watson,
though much the smaller man, displayed great science and activity, and in
the end proved the conqueror.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The skill and courage exhibited by Watson on this occasion, led to his
being noticed by Jackson, then in high patronage. He was accordingly
selected to contend with Bill Jones, mentioned under <span class='sc'>Tyne</span> (p. 128).<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c009'><sup>[78]</sup></a> The
battle came off before the Prince, Colonel Hanger, and other guests at the
Pavilion, and residents at Brighton, August 6th, 1788. The battle was
spirited and scientific for about fifteen minutes, but so much to the advantage
of Watson that Jones fell from weakness, and got down suspiciously more than
once. (It must be remembered that only a month had elapsed since he was
defeated by Tyne). At the end of eighteen minutes, Watson having hit him
down heavily with both hands, Jones surrendered.</p>

<p class='c007'>A strong outsider, named Anderson, a tinman, from the “land o’ cakes,”
challenged Watson, and the day was fixed for April 25, 1789; accordingly
the men met at Langley Broom, near Colnbrook, on the Windsor Road.
Watson went in so resolutely that Anderson fell in two minutes, and
nothing could induce him again to face his antagonist. The reporter adds,
“the amateurs complained loudly that Anderson had played <em>cross</em>.”<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c009'><sup>[79]</sup></a> A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>second fight was got up for a purse between Joe Ward and Townsend, which
Joe won in twenty minutes; Townsend being <em>said</em> to have broken his arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Watson’s next encounter was with the formidable Hooper, by whom he
was defeated, after a long fight of 150 minutes and 100 rounds, at Langley
Broom, February 17, 1790. (See <span class='sc'>Hooper</span>, p. 105.)</p>

<p class='c007'>A townsman of Watson’s, and a brother “kill-bull,” of the name of Davies,
proposed a “passage of arms” to our hero, and despite disparity of weight
and size, Bob accepted the cartel. They met at Coalharbour, Gloucestershire,
January 10, 1791. Watson was the favourite at long odds; but after the
first ten minutes they changed rapidly. Bob’s science and shifting did not
avail against the strength and quickness of Davis, who was by no means
destitute of skill. Though at such a disadvantage, however, Watson never
lost heart, and disputed every inch of ground with firmness and occasional
advantage for three quarters of an hour, despite the remonstrances of his
second, Bill Warr, till he could no longer stand. His second then gave in for
him. Bob’s appearance upon any stage raised his character even in defeat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Watson now returned to the regular pursuit of his trade, and was in
business as a master butcher in Bristol for more than forty years from this
period. He still took an interest in matters pugilistic, as we shall see
incidentally in these pages, and often seconded, more especially in the
neighbourhood of Bristol. Watson frequently gave expositions of the art on
the stage of the Bristol theatre and in London. In 1810 he was engaged at
Covent Garden with the younger Warr (son of Will Warr) and demonstrated
the art in a scene in the pantomime. Warr, in an impetuous onset, knocked
out one of Watson’s teeth, who proposed a combat then and there. This
would have been an unrehearsed effect, and was of course prevented. Bob
threw up his engagement, but was pacified by having another boxer to
perform with him. He died in September, 1837, aged 71 years, generally
respected.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOM TYNE, “THE TAILOR”—1788‒1792.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Among the minor pugilists, Tom Tyne deserves a passing notice. The
vulgar proverb of “nine tailors make a man” found its exception in this
small-sized but large-souled boxer, who always fought “up-hill” against
weight and inches, displaying much science, and in those rough days what
was called too much “shiftiness.” Tyne’s first recorded fight came off at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Croydon on the 1st of July, 1788, for 50 guineas. His opponent was Bill
Jones, a powerful boxer, and who had earned a name by defeating Dunn, a
clumsy and game Irishman, in Bloomsbury Fields, in 1786, besides other
bye-battles. On this occasion Jones was seconded by Joe Ward, and Tyne by
the renowned Tom Johnson. As it is our plan nothing to extenuate nor
set down aught in malice, we shall, as is our practice, where possible, print
the contemporary report.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tyne evidently possessed the advantage in science, independent of his
great superiority arising from the shy mode of shifting and dropping. Jones,
on the contrary, stood manfully up to his man, and made many dexterous
efforts, which, however, were frustrated by the illusive and evasive system
of his antagonist, who always fell whenever he received or put in a blow.
Jones had in point of beating the worst of the battle, but still the best prospect
of ultimate success, from his superior strength and bottom; until by
following up a blow too far, he struck his antagonist unfairly, somewhere
about the waistband of the breeches, when Tyne was immediately declared
the conqueror.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom’s next display was in the presence of royalty, and proved most unfortunate
in its result. On August 6th, 1788, the Grand Stand on Brighton
Race-course was crowded with nobility and gentry to witness the decision of
three matches on a stage erected for that purpose. The Prince of Wales and
a large party from the Pavilion were present. The first combatants were
Bill Jones, already mentioned, and Watson, of Bristol (see <span class='sc'>Watson</span>); the
second, Joe Ward and Reynolds (see <span class='sc'>Ward</span>); the third, between our hero
and Earl.</p>

<p class='c007'>This contest, unhappily for Tom, ended in a fatal accident. Earl was a
powerful rustic, far heavier and taller than Tom, whose height was five feet
seven inches, and weight nine stone seven pounds. Earl from his appearance
was the favourite at odds, and “was becoming triumphant very fast, when
Tyne struck him a sharp left-handed blow on the side of the head, which
drove him against the rail of the stage. He fell insensible, and immediately
expired. The Prince of Wales, greatly to his honour,” adds the reporter,
“immediately settled an annuity on the wife and family of Earl, and took
the determination never to be present at another pugilistic contest.” We
hope the first promise was kept better than the second, otherwise the prince’s
annuity was merely another stone in the pavement of that place where “good
intentions” are said to make the roadway smooth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom was now matched against a clever boxer, Elisha Crabbe, the Jew,
who had earned some fame by beating “Old Oliver,” as he was termed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>The battle took place in a field adjoining Boston Moor, on Monday, March
24, 1790. We copy the report from the <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tyne had Johnson for his second, and James, the waterman, for his
bottle-holder. Lee seconded the Jew, and Joe Ward held the bottle. At
about half-past two the contending bruisers appeared, amidst at least 2,000
spectators, and on stripping, six to four was betted in favour of the tailor.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—There was some extremely good
sparring; they both closed, and Crabbe fell,
but gave his adversary a severe blow on the
nose which produced great effusion of blood.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The Jew gave his opponent a real
knock-down blow, and fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Tyne again fell by his antagonist’s
blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Tyne received another knock-down
blow, but gave the Jew a most severe cut on
the left eye, and another on the mouth.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Tyne dropped, and it was generally
considered by design; great cry of “foul,
foul,” and the odds sunk five to four on the
tailor.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—Was the best round during the contest,
and in which science was most admirably
displayed by both combatants; it lasted
above a minute, and afforded some most
skilful blows.</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—Crabbe fell by a severe blow on the
eye.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—Tyne most adroitly fell, and his antagonist
making a severe blow, flew over
him, and falling on the stage, cut his face
dreadfully.</p>

<p class='c022'>39.—This was the last round; Tyne again
fell by a slight blow, and Crabbe was so
exhausted that he fell on his belly, being
utterly incapable of standing the contest any
longer. In the intermediate rounds there
was good sparring, but no blows of consequence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The battle lasted thirty-five minutes. Crabbe sparred the best, but
Tyne never failed to make his blows tell, notwithstanding he frequently fell
himself. The Jew several times attempted to chop, but in this failed.
Johnson on this occasion displayed most excellent qualities as a second, and
the event of the contest depended much on his conduct.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom’s next appearance was in the ring in Hyde Park, on Friday, December
31, 1792. Firby, previously known as “Jack the waiter,” from his
being employed in that capacity, at the London Tavern, though a civil
fellow, had earned the title of “The Young Ruffian,” from his victory over
Symonds, “The Old Ruffian,” in the previous year. Firby made a severe
fight with Tyne, and, despite Tom’s cleverness in shifting and dropping,
managed to force the fighting so cleverly, that he beat him off in twenty-two
minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Tyne has two fights with Mendoza credited to his name in “Fistiana,”
which appear nowhere in “the books.” This was Tyne’s last public appearance
as a principal. He is named once or twice afterwards as a second. He
returned to his trade, and became “<em>Sartor Resartus</em>.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>SYMONDS, NICKNAMED “THE RUFFIAN.”—1791‒1795.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The repulsive <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</span></i> given to this boxer had, we find from contemporary
authority, no relation to his personal appearance, nor to his ordinary
behaviour, but was merely applied in ring slang to his mode of attacking his
opponents in the twenty-four feet square, in defiance of mathematics called
“the ring.” The ugly part of his cognomen descended to his juvenile
conqueror, Firby, the waiter, who was designated “the Young Ruffian,” and
Symonds thereafter was known by the epithet of “the Old Ruffian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Symonds’ first recorded ring fight was with Bill Jackling (called Ginger,
from the colour of his hair), brother to the renowned Tom Johnson, the
champion. This took place at Wrotham in Kent, on January 17, 1791, after
his brother had been defeated by Big Ben (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 68). It was a severe
fight for twenty-three minutes, when Symonds was hit out of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>His next encounter was at Fenner’s cricket ground, Uxbridge, with
Gowlett, for 10 guineas, on the 22nd June, 1791. The battle was got up as
a sort of compensation for the disappointment of the amateurs who were
about to journey to Stokenchurch, Oxfordshire, to witness the battle between
Dan Mendoza and Bill Warr. The Oxfordshire magistrates, however, had
given notice of their intention to stop the “big” fight, and it was postponed.
(See Life of <span class='sc'>Mendoza</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 76.) The men fought on the turf. The
opponent of Symonds, Gowlett, was a big countrymen of provincial repute.
Symonds, who was more practised than his huge opponent, delivered heavily,
and then, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i> Bendigo, found his way cleverly to the ground. In the
words of the report, “Symonds sprung in, struck, and then fell, without
being struck in return.” This is very obscure. However, “Gowlett, being
irritated, kicked him as he lay on the ground. This decided the battle
immediately in favour of Symonds.” We should think so. What follows is
curious: “Many bets were paid; but after a consultation, the amateurs
deciding it to be a drawn battle, the bets were refunded.” Our grandfathers
were somewhat at sea as to betting law. However, as the Duke of Hamilton,
Alderman Macauley, and other “distinguished patrons” were present,
we suppose they acted equitably, according to their view of the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fine young fellow, Jack Firby, a waiter at the London Tavern, met
Symonds for a stake at Wimbledon, on the Ridgway, August 2, 1791, and
defeated him, after a slashing fight of forty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>On Saturday, December 4, 1792, Symonds fought a most resolute battle of
two hours with George Maddox at Datchet Sward, Berks, resulting in a
draw. (See <span class='sc'>Maddox</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>, p. 206.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Symonds’ last appearance in the ring was on the 15th of April, 1795,
when he fought a draw with a Jew, called Ugly Baruk, at Hornchurch; it
lasted half an hour. For some years Symonds was an attendant at the Fives
Court, and elsewhere, and was, like Firby, a good-tempered, obliging fellow,
always ready to lend a hand to a brother pugilist in distress. Symonds died
in 1820.</p>

</div>
<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h4 class='c016'>JEM BELCHER (CHAMPION)—1798‒1809.</h4>

<p class='c013'>On the roll of fistic heroes to whom Bristol has given birth, the name
of <span class='sc'>Jem Belcher</span> may claim precedence. He came of a good fighting stock,
being descended by the mother’s side from the renowned Jem Slack, the
conqueror of Broughton, the former being the grandsire of the subject of this
memoir.</p>

<p class='c007'>On his first appearance in the London Ring, he was justly considered
a phenomenon in the pugilistic art. Jem’s height was five feet eleven and a
half inches; his weight under twelve stone. Though graceful and finely
proportioned, he had none of those muscular exaggerations in his form
when stripped, and still less when attired, which go, in the artistic as well
as the popular notion, to make up a Hercules. Jem was formed more after
the sculptor’s Apollo than the not-very-accurate classical idea, derived from
bronze and marble, of a gladiator. In horse, as in man, this antique blunder
is laughed at by those who have read and seen something more than Greek
and Latin books or monuments can teach them. The horses of the Parthenon
might do for Pickford’s vans, “a black job,” or a man in armour in my Lord
Mayor’s show (and they would not carry <em>him</em> well); while Jem Belcher,
Henry Pearce, Tom Spring, Jem Ward, or Tom Sayers, could thrash all
your shoulder-tied, muscle-knotted, chairman-calved Milos that ever didn’t
do the impossibles which ancient poets and fabulists, called historians, have
attributed to them in verse and prose. But this is digression, and we return.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>JAMES BELCHER, <span class='sc'>of Bristol</span> (<span class='sc'>Champion of England</span>), 1798‒1809.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>James Belcher struggled into the battle of life in St. James’s Churchyard,
Bristol, on the 15th of April, 1781. He there, for some time, followed the
occupation of a butcher, and early signalised himself by feats of pugilism and
activity at Lansdown Fair.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c009'><sup>[80]</sup></a> At twenty years of age his skill with the gloves
was the talk of the town, and he baffled the cleverest professors of the old
school on their visits to Bristol, which were then neither few nor far between.
His method appeared so peculiarly his own that it looked like intuition, and
some of the “ould ’uns” who were sceptical as to his prowess, would not
believe in it until they had experienced in their own persons the irresistibility
of his attack and the cleverness of his almost invulnerable and ever-varying
defence. Gaiety and intrepidity were combined in Jem’s style with curious
felicity, and the rapidity with which he “got in” upon his opponent, the
skill with which he retreated, armed at all points, and the masterly manner
in which he “got out of trouble,” to the surprise of his assailant, were truly
astonishing—in two words, Jem Belcher was a “natural fighter,” perfected
by the practice of his art.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first recorded fight of Belcher was with Britton, a pugilist of some
notoriety, who afterwards contended with Dutch Sam; the contest took place
near Bristol, on the 6th of March, 1798; it was a sharp and severe contest,
in which Belcher, the boy of seventeen, disposed of his antagonist in thirty-three
minutes, Britton being beaten to a stand-still, to the utter surprise of
the spectators.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our hero now came up to town, where his reputation accompanied
him; being introduced to old Bill Warr, who then kept a house in Covent
Garden, the “ould ’un” had a mind to judge personally of the merits of the
young aspirant for pugilistic fame, and accordingly put on the gloves with
him for a little “breathing” in his (Warr’s) own dining-room. The veteran,
who in his best days was no Belcher, was so astounded at Jem’s quickness in
hitting and recovering guard, that he puffed out, as he reeled against one of
his tables, impelled thither by a “Belcherian” tip, “That’ll do; this
youngster can go in with any man in the kingdom!” Jem quietly observed,
during the discussion after dinner, “I could have done better, sir, but I was
afraid I might hit you too hard, and that you would be offended.”—“Oh!”
cried the undaunted veteran, “I was never afraid of a crack, my boy, and
am not now; we’ll have a round, and you may do your best.” So saying,
they instantly set-to, when Jem, almost at the request of his host, quietly
hit him down several times, despite of the “ould ’un’s” attempts at stopping
or countering. Warr was fully satisfied of Belcher’s talents; they sat down
sociably, and Bill offered to back the young Bristolian against anything on
the pugilistic list.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Tom Jones, of Paddington, whose career closed the final chapter of the
Second Period, was selected as the trial-horse of the new competitor in the
race for fame and its more substantial rewards. The battle took place on
Wormwood Scrubbs, on the 12th of April, 1799, for 25 guineas aside. The
peculiar features of Belcher’s science were well displayed; and although
Jones contended for victory with desperate determination, unflinching courage,
and no small amount of skill and readiness, he was doomed to “pale his
ineffective fires” before the rising luminary of Belcher’s fame. Thirty-three
minutes of courageous and determined fighting placed the future champion’s
star in the ascendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jack Bartholomew, a pugilist whose victories over the gluttonous Firby
(known as the “Young Ruffian”), Tom Owen, and others, had placed him
high in the estimation of “the fancy,” was now picked out as a customer
very likely to try the mettle of Belcher. Bartholomew was in high favour
among the ring-goers, his weight between twelve and thirteen stone, his
qualifications considerable, and his game of the first order. The stakes in the
first instance were small, being but £20 a-side, owing to the affair arising
out of a longing desire on the part of Bartholomew to try his skill with the
Bristol “Phenomenon,” he himself feeling no apprehension as to the result.
He accordingly challenged Jem for this sum, offering to “fight him for love,”
rather than lose the opportunity of a “shy.” The mill came off, almost
extemporaneously, August 15, 1799, at George’s Row, on the Uxbridge
Road, and was so severely and evenly contested (Belcher was declared to be
out of condition), that neither could be declared the conqueror. Towards
the end of the fight Bartholomew was so completely exhausted that he
fainted away, and could not come to time; and Jem so much done up, that
it was with difficulty he was got up to the scratch. In fact, both men were
out of time. Bartholomew, in the interval, recovering a little from his
weakness, insisted upon renewing the combat, when the ring was again
made; but he staggered about without command of himself, and appeared
literally stupid. His game was so good, but his state so pitiable, that
Cullington,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c009'><sup>[81]</sup></a> feeling for his bravery, exclaimed, “For heaven’s sake, Jem,
don’t hit him!” upon which Belcher merely pushed him down; in fact,
he was himself so exhausted as to be unable to make an effectual hit. The
umpires pronounced it a drawn battle; and the stakes, which were held by
Bill Gibbons’s brother, were drawn the same night at Cullington’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Bartholomew possessed pluck of the first order, it was not to be supposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>the matter would rest here; accordingly the world pugilistic was soon
on the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</span></i> for another match, which was arranged for 300 guineas.
This was fought upon a stage on Finchley Common, on Thursday, May
15, 1800. Bartholomew was at this time 37 years of age, Belcher just
turned 20.</p>

<p class='c007'>The combatants mounted the stage at half-past one o’clock, and little time
was lost in preliminaries. Bartholomew had determined that sparring should
avail Belcher but little, and ding-dong rushes were the game he had resolved
on. Belcher, even in the early rounds of the fight, exhibited the tactics,
afterwards conspicuous in some of Cribb’s battles, of “milling on the retreat;”
but Bartholomew would not be denied, and seconded by his great strength
and weight, he got in, planted upon Belcher, and hit him clean down with
such violence, as to induce his over-sanguine friends to start off an express,
per pigeon, to London, with the intelligence of their man’s victory. They
were, however, premature, for Jem, taught by experience, did not give
Bartholomew a chance of thus stealing a march on him; after pinking Bartholomew
once or twice, he warded off his lunge, and catching him cleverly,
threw him so dreadful a cross-buttock, that he was never entirely himself
again during the fight. The odds now changed. Yet Bartholomew bravely
contended, disputing every round with unyielding firmness, till the close of
the seventeenth round, and the expiration of twenty minutes, when Belcher
floored him with so terrific a body blow that all was U-P. The contest,
considering the shortness of its duration, was considered the most desperate
which had been witnessed for many years, and the loser was severely
punished. It is erroneously stated in “Boxiana” (p. 129, vol. i.) that
Belcher and Bartholomew fought again; but no date or place is mentioned,
nor did any such battle ever come off. “Immediately after the fight,” says
the report, “Bartholomew was taken into custody on a judge’s warrant, for
breaking the peace before the expiration of his bond. He was brought to
town in a coach, but bailed out immediately.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Andrew Gamble, the “Irish champion,” was now backed by several influential
amateurs to enter the lists with Belcher. Accordingly a match was
made for 100 guineas, to be decided on Wimbledon Common, on Monday,
December 22, 1800; and on that day vehicles of all descriptions, and crowds
of pedestrians, flocked to witness this combat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The journals of the day give on many occasions a sort of <cite>Morning Post</cite> list
of “fashionables” on these occasions. On the present we find enumerated
Lord Say and Sele, Colonels Montgomery and Ogle, Captain Desmond,
Squire Mountain, Messrs. Cullington, Lee, Kelly, Aldridge, etc.; and among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>the professionals, John Jackson, Paddington Jones, Bill Gibbons, Caleb
Baldwin, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Belcher entered the ring about twelve o’clock, accompanied by his second,
Joe Ward, with Bill Gibbons as his bottle-holder, and Tom Tring as an
assistant. Mendoza was second to Gamble; his bottle-holder, Coady; and
old Elisha Crabbe as deputy. Messrs. Mountain, Lee, and Cullington were
chosen umpires; the latter also was stakeholder.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding Gamble had beat Noah James, the Cheshire champion, a
pugilist who had been successful in seventeen pitched battles, and whose
game was said to be superior to any man in the kingdom, still the bets from
the first making of the match were six to four in favour of Belcher; and
Bill Warr, before the combatants stripped, offered twenty-five guineas to
twenty. On stripping, Gamble appeared much the heavier man, and his
friends and countrymen offered five to four on him; but that was by no
means the opinion of the London cognoscenti. A few minutes before one
the fight commenced.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—After some sparring, Gamble
made play, but was prettily parried by Belcher,
who, with unequalled celerity, planted
in return three severe facers: they soon
closed, and Belcher, being well aware of the
superiority of his opponent’s strength, dropped.
(The Paddies, in their eagerness to support
their countryman, here offered five to four.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Belcher, full of spirit, advanced towards
Gamble, who retreated. Jem made a
feint with his right hand, and with his left
struck Gamble so severely over the right
eye, as not only to close it immediately, but
knock him down with uncommon violence.
(Two to one on Belcher.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Gamble again retreated, but put in
several severe blows in the body of his antagonist
with some cleverness. Belcher, by
a sharp hit, made the claret fly copiously;
but Gamble, notwithstanding, threw Belcher
with considerable violence, and fell upon
him cross-ways. (The odds rose four to one
upon Jem.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Belcher, full of coolness and self-possession,
showed first-rate science. His blows
were well directed, and severe, particularly
one in the neck, which brought Gamble
down. (Ten to one Belcher was the winner.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5th and last round.—Gamble received two
such blows that struck him all of a heap—one
in the mark, that nearly deprived him
of breath, and the other on the side, which
instantly swelled considerably. Gamble fell
almost breathless, and when “time” was
called, gave in. It is reported that not less
than £20,000 changed hands on this occasion.
The Irish were full of murmurings at
Gamble’s conduct, who was beaten in five
rounds, and in the short space of nine
minutes! Gamble fought very badly. From
his former experience much was expected,
but he appeared utterly confused at his
opponent’s quickness. Belcher treated Gamble’s
knowledge of the art with the utmost
contempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>It may be worth noticing that the “Pride of Westminster,” in after years
known as Caleb Baldwin, described in the report as a “dealer in greens,”
polished off a big Irishman, named Kelly, in fifteen minutes, twelve rounds,
for a purse of 20 guineas, in the same ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Belcher was witnessing the battle between Bittoon the Jew and Tom
Jones, on Wimbledon Common, on Monday, July 13, 1801, Joe Berks, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>was excited and quarrelsome, made a disturbance in the outer ring,<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c009'><sup>[82]</sup></a> and
offensively called out, “Where’s young Jem Belcher? where’s your champion?”
Jem went up to him and asked him what he wanted; the reply to
which was a blow, cleverly warded off. A fierce set-to followed, for Jem
was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">semper paratus</span></i>, when Berks displayed so much courage and strength,
that the spectators did not know what to think about the finish of this
impromptu affair. The combat lasted nineteen minutes, and although Berks
was beaten, an opinion became prevalent that had not Belcher applied all he
knew of the science, and Berks fought, as it was termed, “hand over hand,”
there was great probability of Jem’s falling before the resolute onslaught of
the Shropshire man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Berks having shown so much game under such evident disadvantages,
Lord Camelford determined to back him for a second combat in a more
regular manner, for 100 guineas. He was accordingly put out to nurse; a
teacher appointed to initiate him into the mysteries of the science; and it
was reported of Berks that he was a promising child—took his food regularly,
minded what his master said to him, and, for the short time that he
had taken to study, great improvement was visible. Berks ultimately turned
out one of the most troublesome customers, and the hardest to be disposed of,
that ever entered the lists with Belcher.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Saturday, September 12, 1801, Belcher met Berks, at the Cock, in
Sun Street, Spitalfields, when Jem accepted his formal challenge for 100
guineas, and seven days after, on the 19th, they met at the same house, to
proceed to the battle-field—a rare instance of promptitude and eagerness on
both sides; but the police having scent of the affair, a magistrate’s warrant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>was issued, and the battle postponed to the 12th of the next month. As
there is no trace of these proceedings in “Boxiana,” and they are amusing as
well as curious to the ring-goer, showing the disappointments and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus
operandi</span></i> of the ring in the olden times, we reprint the account from a contemporary
newspaper; and as a specimen of what then was thought smart
writing in the fashionable world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On Monday (12th October, 1801), as had been agreed upon, the long expected
battle between James Belcher and Joseph Bourkes (Joe Berks) was
to have taken place at Enfield, but much to the chagrin of the amateurs and
lovers of the pugilistic art, it was prevented by the interposition of Mr.
Ford, the magistrate of Bow Street, who, having received information of the
intended combat, issued a warrant against Belcher, and on the Sunday night
previous Townsend took him into limbo. Many circumstances combined to
excite a most extraordinary degree of expectation, and produced a multitudinous
attendance on this attractive occasion. The late ratification of peace
had tended to annihilate fighting;<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c009'><sup>[83]</sup></a> conversation which had been so lively
supported by the race of two famous horses, Sir Solomon and Cock-fighter,
had now become exhausted in the sporting circle; the combatants being of
the highest renown in the science, could not fail to animate every amateur;
and, to add still greater numbers to the assembly, a violent thunder-storm on
the Saturday night had kept the heroes, who on that evening enjoy themselves,
altogether inactive. All the loose cash, all the turbulence that had been
amassed that night, now prompted by curiosity, broke forth with increased
avidity. The ‘fight’ was the very goal of attraction; it consolidated every
vagrant wish, every undecided mind, and every idle hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This match first became the subject of contemplation from an accidental
skirmish during the fight between Bittoon and Tom Jones, at Wimbledon, in
which, although Berks seemingly had the worst of it, the amateurs considered
it as a matter of surprise; and no previous training having taken
place on either side, much consequence was not attached to the defeat, nor
was it considered decisive of the merits of the rival heroes. Many knowing
ones indeed conceived that Berks got thrashed in this contest only through
his own rashness, and entertaining flattering hopes of his powers, took him
into private nursing. Raw eggs to improve his wind, and raw beef to make
him savage, were the glorious non-naturals that composed his regimen, and
in all his exercises he topped even expectation’s self. All this was done in
the anxious trust that Belcher would be backed with great odds, as he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>thought to be the favourite with all, excepting those in the secret. They,
however, did not manage with all that address which experience proves so
requisite to gull the world; it soon spread that Berks had been in training,
and had considerably improved in his sparring. Odds then took a contrary
direction, but when the amateurs who con o’er these sublime subjects began
to consider that Belcher, although not in training, had lived temperately,
was in good condition, and full of stiff meat, he again became the favorite,
and on the ground six to four were the standing odds.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The hours appointed in the articles for the decision of the contest were
between twelve and two. At about one o’clock Berks appeared on the stage,
stripped, and began to show play for the amusement of his friends, who did
not forget to make the welkin ring with their plaudits; however, Belcher
not ascending the stage as expected, he dressed himself again, amidst cries of
‘Where is Belcher?’ Berks immediately assumed the attitude, not of a
fighter, but of an orator, and in the following eloquent manner addressed the
multitude:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Gemmen, I com’d here, d’ye see, to fight Jim Belcher. I’m here, and
he isn’t. I wish he had; for, on the word of a butcher, I’d have cleaved
his calf’s head, and given him such a chop in the kidneys, as would soon
have brought him on his marrow bones.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The cry of ‘Where is Belcher?’ still continued, when Gamble, the Irish
bruiser, came forward—‘Where is he? why at Bow-street, to be sure; he
was grabbed on the road.’ This was not the fact, but something near it.
The suspense, however, was not of long duration: two friends of Jemmy’s
arrived with the sad and melancholy tidings of the ‘queer tip’ he had met
with the last night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bill Warr, Gamble, Lee, Jackson, many amateurs, and the usual number
of pickpockets, were present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On Wednesday, November 25th, 1801, this oft postponed contest was
brought to a decision. The greatest secrecy was observed, and “it was only
on the Tuesday afternoon that the field of battle was precisely determined
on. A stage was erected at Hurley Bottom, four and a-half miles from
Maidenhead, between the Henley and Reading roads, thirty-two miles from
Hyde Park turnpike.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At ten minutes after twelve Belcher made his appearance, accompanied
by his second, Joe Ward, and by a Bristol youth, as his bottle-holder, who
was unknown to the London bruisers. He immediately began to strip, and
when prepared, took the precaution of particularly examining the stage, lest
any roughness or nail might do him an eventual injury. Shortly after Berks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>appeared, attended by Harry Lee, as his second, and George Rhodes, his
bottle-holder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The combatants shook hands, and immediately set to. Bets, seven to
four and two to one on Belcher.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Several severe blows were exchanged.
Berks showed in better style than
usual. He put in a well directed hit under
his antagonist’s right eye, who staggered.
The men closed, and both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>2, 3, and 4.—During these rounds neither
combatant displayed science, notwithstanding
some good blows were reciprocally given
and received.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Belcher made a feint with his left
hand, and with his right put in so sharp a
hit on the nose of his opponent, that he laid
it open, and brought him down with great
violence. (Bets ten to one offered, but refused.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Much shy fighting, Berks keeping out
at distance. Belcher at length struck Berks
over the forehead, and cut him again
severely; the blood now issued so freely
from his wounds, that Lee could scarcely
find handkerchiefs sufficient to keep him
clean.</p>

<p class='c022'>7 and 8.—Little done; Belcher propped
Berks, who fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Berks being the stronger man, rushed
in, got a hold, and threw his antagonist with
great violence.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—This was the best contested round
throughout the battle, and was truly desperate
fighting.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—At the conclusion of this round Berks
was quite exhausted, and it is but justice to
his gallantry and courage to record that,
although in so dreadful a state, he refused to
give in, and the yielding word was uttered
by his second.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—“The battle, which undoubtedly
was the most desperately contested of
any since that of Big Ben and Johnson in
the year 1791, lasted twenty-five minutes;
but although it displayed the height of
courage on both sides, it was by no means so
gratifying to the scientific amateur as many
battles of the old school; very few straight
blows were struck, but both the combatants
fought round, and made a hugging fight
of it.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Berks was much cut and dreadfully
bruised in the body. During the fight he
displayed wonderful activity and bottom, but
not an equal portion of skill. At the conclusion
he was immediately put into a post-chaise,
but very cruelly left there until after
the decision of another battle, and then conveyed
to town.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Belcher appeared not the least hurt, and
declared he never felt a blow during the
whole of the battle; he was very highly
elated by having gained the laurel, and still
more perhaps the stake. He challenged
Mendoza, who was present, and offered to fight
him in a month for 300 to 200 guineas. To
this bravado, Mendoza, greatly to his commendation,
calmly answered, that he had
given up the pugilistic profession; that he
supported by his exertions, as landlord of
the Lord Nelson, in Whitechapel, a family
of six children. There was only one man
he would fight, which was Jackson; his
unhandsome and unfair conduct in a prior
contest having excited his greatest indignation.”
Dan ended a wily speech by declaring
he would fight Jackson for 100 guineas, with
a proviso that he should not avail himself of
what he called the “base and cowardly
advantage” of holding the hair of his antagonist.
See <span class='sc'>Mendoza</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 79.</p>

<p class='c013'>Caleb Baldwin, on this occasion also, added a second fight to the day’s
proceedings, his antagonist being Lee, the butcher, whom he beat in twenty-three
minutes.—See Life of <span class='sc'>Caleb Baldwin</span>, Appendix to Period IV.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Say and Sele, the Hon. Berkeley Craven, Sir Thomas Apreece,
Colonel Montgomery, Captain Taylor, and other distinguished amateurs, were
among the spectators.</p>

<p class='c007'>We read in the newspapers of the day that “Lord Radnor, as Lord
Lieutenant of the county of Berks., soon after the fight, issued warrants for
the apprehension of James Belcher and Joseph Berks, as combatants, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Harry Lee and Joe Ward, the seconds, ‘for unlawfully assembling and
publicly fighting at Hurley, in the county of Berkshire.’ They were taken
into custody, and on Friday, January 29th, 1802, Belcher, Lee, and Ward,
appeared at Bow Street, before Mr. Bond, and Mr. Reed, of Chelsea, with
their bail (Mr. Brown, and Mr. Evans, an oyster merchant in Hungerford
Market), where they entered into sureties for their appearance to answer this
charge in the county of Berks., themselves in £200, and their bail in £100
each. Poor Berks was most shamefully deserted and neglected by all his
friends, in this hour of need, and not being able to procure bail, remained
‘in durance vile’ at the common gaol of Reading.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The then chief magistrate of Bow-street seems to have been particularly
busy in the proceedings of Belcher, for we find, in the interim between his
bail and surrender, that he stopped even a sparring match. “On Tuesday,
April 6th, 1802, Belcher had announced a display of the art of self-defence,
at a public-house called the Peahen, in Gray’s Inn Lane. Gamble, Belcher,
and several pugilists of fame set-to, and highly diverted an immense concourse
of persons until about ten o’clock, when Mr. Bond having received
information, despatched officers, who very kindly paid them a visit, and took
into custody not only the principals but the whole of the company, and
lodged them in the Compter for the night.” The paragraph writer then
becomes clumsily facetious about the appropriate transfer of the population
of the Peahen to the Poultry Compter.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c009'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In May, 1802, “on the last day of the Quarter Sessions at Newbury,
Belcher, Joe Ward, and Harry Lee, appeared with their bail,” and poor
Berks was brought up from the gaol. Jem’s aristocratic patrons had been
busy, for we read, “Mr. Dundas, the Chairman of the Sessions, addressed
them: he said the prosecution was at the instance of the county, but had
been moved by certiorari into the Court of King’s Bench. He admonished
them to leave off the pugilistic profession, and particularly directed his observations
to Belcher, of whose generally peaceable conduct he had heard so
favourable a report. The Court was very highly pleased at the respectful
manner in which they all surrendered themselves to the laws of their country;
and it was understood, that unless they were again sufficiently atrocious to
violate them, they would not be called upon to answer for their misconduct.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the latter end of this month, May, notwithstanding this advice, the
following paragraph appeared in the <cite>Oracle</cite>: “Belcher and Berks have been
matched at Newmarket by Captain Fletcher and Fletcher Reid, Esq., for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>200 guineas a-side. Belcher has already set off to Yorkshire, to put himself
in training, accompanied by Joe Ward, and Berks remains in the neighbourhood
of Newmarket for the same purpose. The battle is agreed to take place
within six weeks, but where or when will be kept as much a secret as
possible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The best accounts of the disappointments these olden gymnasts met with
in their attempts to decide this contest, may be collected from the following
excerpts:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>BELCHER AND BERKS.</div>
    <div class='c002'><em>From the</em> <span class='sc'>York Herald</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“The boxing match made some time since, at Newmarket, to be fought by the above-named,
it was agreed by the parties, should be decided on Thursday, June 17, between the
hours of twelve and two, at the village of Grewelthorpe, about six miles from Ripon. The
above village is in the West Riding; the division of that part of the county and the North
Riding taking place there. Accordingly, on the morning of Thursday, a stage was erected
at the bottom of a close adjoining the house of Mr. Pickersgill; the money, amounting to
£1,450 a-side, deposited by the parties, and every necessary preparation made. In consequence
of information having been previously sent to the magistrates, the Very Reverend the
Deans of Ripon and Middleham, with several of the justices for the North and West Ridings,
attended at Grewelthorpe, and signified their determination to put a stop to all such outrageous
proceedings; but finding that the business was likely to be proceeded with, and that
a number of people were assembling, they ordered the Riot Act to be read, which was
accordingly done about twelve o’clock, by Mr. Taylors, the Town Clerk. However, between
one and two o’clock, Belcher, with his second, etc., went upon the stage, and was followed by
Berks, upon which Mr. Trapps went down to inform them, that if they did not instantly quit
the stage, and the neighbourhood, they and their parties would be apprehended. They
immediately obeyed, and left Grewelthorpe soon after.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c017'>
    <div><em>From the</em> <span class='sc'>Morning Post</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“It appears that on Thursday, June 17, a stage, on which it was intended that Belcher
and Berks should exhibit a fresh trial of their skill and strength, was erected in a bye place,
about twenty miles distant from Middleham, in Yorkshire, and so conveniently situated for
the purpose, that no persons present could have been deprived of a full view of the fight.
At one o’clock, Fletcher Reid, Esq., on the part of Belcher, and Captain Fletcher, on behalf
of Berks, met on the appointed spot, to make good the stake of 1,450 guineas a-side, being
the sum for which Belcher and Berks were matched to fight. The conditions having been
fulfilled, Belcher appeared on the stage at a quarter before two o’clock, attended by Joe
Ward as his second, and Bill Gibbons as his bottle-holder; and shortly after Berks joined
them, with Crabbe as his bottle-holder, but no second. The two bruisers shook hands, and
Berks observed, ‘that it would now be determined which was the best man;’ to which Belcher
replied, ‘he was surprised he did not know that already.’ There were several hundred
persons present on the tiptoe of expectation to see the conflict commence; but the combatants
could not set-to, as Harry Lee had not ascended the stage, who was Berks’ promised
second. On his name being called out among the crowd, he answered to it; but when asked
why he did not appear in his place, he gave no other explanation than that he would have
nothing to do with the fight. This circumstance produced general dissatisfaction, as it was
declared that this determination on the part of Lee could only have been occasioned by a
previous understanding between him and Berks’ friends, who now began to think of the large
sums they had betted, and the little chance they had of success. No bets could be procured
on the ground, without staking considerable odds. As Berks refused to accept any other
second in the room of Lee, all hopes of a contest now vanished, and the champions retired
from the stage. Belcher, however, unwilling to disappoint the company, offered to have a
few rounds with Berks for pure ‘love,’ but he declined, and immediately set off in a post-chaise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Fletcher Reid, who backed Belcher, made him a present of £50 for
his trouble, and £5 to bear his expenses to London. He also made a present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>to Ward, his second, and to the bottle-holder, with money to bear their
expenses to town.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the beginning of July, 1802, the following letter from Berks appeared
in the <cite>Oracle</cite> and <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“<em>To the Editor of the</em> <span class='sc'>Daily Advertiser</span>.</p>

<p class='c018'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—The wager for which I was to have fought with Belcher, at Grewelthorpe, in
Yorkshire, was 1,450 guineas a-side; Captain Fletcher betting upon me, and Mr. Fletcher
Reid upon Belcher; the match was to be fought between twelve and two.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Captain Fletcher was on the stage half an hour before Mr. Fletcher Reid could make up
the sum betted. Belcher did not come upon the stage until half past one, and then appeared
in boots, consequently not very likely with an intention to fight. Immediately on his coming
on the stage, Captain Fletcher came to me at the house, and desired me to put on my fighting
dress, and be ready immediately, which I directly did. I was then asked by Fletcher
Reid, ‘Where is your second?’ I answered, ‘Let us fight without seconds, for Harry Lee
has refused to be one, on account of the magistrates.’</p>

<p class='c018'>“I had wished to fight before the hour named, to prevent the interposition of the magistrates;
for though no man can more respect their authority, which I would not attempt to
resist, I thought it would be fair enough to get a start of them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Mr. Bolton, of York, held the bets, to the amount of 2,900 guineas.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I had been in training seven weeks at Middleham, and was never in better condition.
I ran and leaped with many people, and always beat them. I was exceedingly well treated
by the people there, and must say that Captain Fletcher behaved amazingly well, and like a
gentleman to me. I told him it was not for the sake of money, but of my honour, that I
wanted to fight.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Belcher had not been ten minutes on the stage, when two or three gentlemen came and
told him to get off, for that the magistrates had issued their warrants.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Belcher on this was directly going off, when I said, ‘Belcher, stop and fight at all risks,
and we shall see who is the best man.’ I must say it is not true, as stated in some of the
papers, that Belcher made a reply, ‘that he thought I knew already,’ for he made no
answer, but acted the part of ‘Orator Mum.’</p>

<p class='c018'>“It appears odd to me that Joe Ward was at Grewelthorpe the day before, but did not
appear the day appointed for the fight at all. I do not wish to impute anything wrong to
him, but think it very strange.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The above is a true statement, which nobody will deny, and which Belcher, if he has a

<p class='c013'>On the 19th of August, it being Camberwell Fair, those two disappointed
and hitherto considered equal champions accidentally met, never having seen
each other since their proposed match in Yorkshire. “Belcher first espied
his pugilistic rival entertaining a number of people with the manner in which
he would serve out Belcher the first time he met him; but this seeming to
have happened unexpectedly, their first salute was at least civil. Belcher,
however, could not help expressing his regret that Berks should boast everywhere
of his superior prowess, that he could beat Belcher with ease, that
Belcher was afraid to fight, etc. Berks did not deny these accusations, and
offered to fight him immediately. They then adjourned to the bowling-green
belonging to the house where they met, and Berks attacked Belcher before
he could get his shirt off. However, when they fairly met, Belcher put in a
well-directed hit, knocked out one of Berks’ front teeth, and following it up
with a blow under the ear, brought him down. Berks not being quite sober,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>and Belcher indisposed, their friends agreed that they should meet next day
at Oxendon Street, Leicester Square. This being settled, they separated.”</p>

<p class='c007'>August 20.—“This day they met according to agreement, and after some
negotiation respecting the order of proceeding, they went, each in a separate
hackney coach, accompanied by their friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At a little before one o’clock the parties arrived at Tyburn Turnpike,
where they immediately fixed on the first open space, a large field directly
behind St. George’s Chapel, which faces Hyde Park. The combat having
been so suddenly determined on, very few amateurs were present, excepting
Mr. Fletcher Reid and Mr. Crook. There not being time to build a stage,
an extensive ring was immediately formed, and the multitude, which was
immense, placed around it. The first row almost lying, the second sitting,
the third kneeling, and the remainder standing; those behind thinking themselves
well favoured if they now and then got a peep.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After walking about for a few minutes they began to strip, and when
prepared, Berks asked Mr. Fletcher Reid ‘Whether it should be a fair stand-up
fight.’—‘Certainly, in every way,’ said Mr. R., and immediately called
Belcher to acquaint him with what Berks had asked, when he said ‘Certainly,
I can do no otherwise.’ Berks then requested that the pauses between
each round might be three quarters of a minute, but Belcher’s friends insisted
on the old established interval of half a minute.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A purse of thirty guineas was subscribed for the winner, and five for the
loser, by the amateurs present. A few minutes after one they entered the
ring; Belcher, accompanied by Joe Ward as his second, and Bill Gibbons as
his bottle-holder; and Berks, by Tom Owen as his second, and Yokel, the
Jew, for his bottle-holder. After the accustomed salutation they set-to.”</p>

<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Berks showed in this round
that his hope of gaining the battle rested
upon his superior strength. He ran in,
closed upon Belcher, and tried to throw him,
but failed, when Belcher dexterously accomplished
what his antagonist was so desirous
of doing, and had his man down on the
grass. Some blows were struck, but no
blood drawn.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Berks followed the plan he had commenced
with, ran in, and received a well-aimed
blow from Belcher in the throat,
which drew blood. They closed, and Belcher
again threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Berks once more ran in with great
pluck, and with much adroitness planted a
sharp blow on Belcher’s right cheek bone
with his left hand; he then put in a severe
blow between the shoulder and the breast,
which, had it been lower, would have done
execution. While aiming another blow with
his left hand, Belcher rallied, closed, and a
third time brought Berks down with a hit
and a close.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Berks rushed upon his adversary,
missed his blow, and fell. Here some
groaned, calling out, “Berks is at his old
tricks,” supposing him to be shifting, but his
subsequent conduct showed the fallacy of
such a charge.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Berks ran in with great force, caught
Belcher by the hams, doubled him up, and
threw him in the style of a cross-buttock;
Belcher pitched on his head with such force
it was feared his neck was broken. A cry
of “Foul! foul!” ran round, but Belcher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>rose as sprightly as ever, said he was not
hurt, and in answer to the cries of “Foul,”
said “No, never mind.”</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—This was one of the most severe
rounds that had been fought. Berks ran in
as usual: several severe blows struck on each
side. Belcher tremendously struck Berks on
the side of the head, a second on the neck,
and a third on the throat, all truly severe.
They closed, struggled, changed legs, and
each displayed his utmost skill and strength
in wrestling; at last both fell, neither being
able to claim any advantage.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Berks had lost his gaiety; he seemed
less eager, and his strength evidently began
to fail: when put to the test, he still, however,
showed great spirit. They closed, and
Berks was a fourth time thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Berks during this round fought on the
defensive, but at that he had no chance.
Belcher put in several good blows, and terminated
the round by bringing Berks down
the fifth time.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Bets at this time were twenty to one
in favour of Belcher, who did not appear the
least exhausted. While sparring, he was
nodding and talking to his antagonist, at the
same time putting in some most severe and
unexpected blows. Poor Berks was again
brought down.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Berks set-to with spirit, and came to
close quarters. Belcher put in some awful
hits, and struck unusually sharp: he cut
Berks under the left eye, then under the
right, and thirdly, planted a most dreadful
blow between the throat and chin, so severe
that it lifted Berks off his feet, and his head
came first to the ground. Belcher fell from
the force of his blow, and as they both lay,
the blood gushing up Berks’ throat, he collected
it in his mouth, and squirted it over
Belcher. This he did not relish, and swore
he would pay him for it in the next round.
Berks, however, declared he did not do it
intentionally.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Although Berks was evidently beaten,
he still showed fight. Some blows were
struck, they closed, and Belcher threw Berks,
at the same time falling on his own hands,
not wishing to hurt Berks more by falling
on him, though the practice is customary,
and considered fair in fighting.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c009'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Berks now showed considerable weakness,
sat longer on the ground, and required
greater assistance from his second than before.
This round ended by Belcher’s throwing
him.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Berks again came up; Belcher struck
five or six blows, closed, and again threw
him. Berks was now heard to express a
wish to give in, but his second desiring him
to persevere, put a handkerchief to his
mouth, and stopped his utterance. (This
was disgraceful, and opposed to all rules of
the ring.)</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Berks showed game, but his strength
was gone; in short, he only stood up to be
beat; every one manifestly saw he had no
chance of success. After a few sharpish
blows, Belcher closed and threw him on the
chest, where he laid for some seconds, and
then yielded the palm. He was several
times asked by Joe Ward if he had given in,
and distinctly answered “Yes.” He could
scarcely see or stand, and was so shockingly
cut about the face, that it was impossible to
distinguish a feature. His friends placed
him in a hackney coach, and carried him to
a house in the neighbourhood of Grosvenor
Square.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Belcher carried no marks of
the battle, excepting the bruise on the cheek
bone and his left shoulder. After the battle
was over he leaped with great agility, and
having walked three times round the field,
left it on foot. His style of fighting in this
contest was his own peculiarly, putting in
with astonishing rapidity his three successive
blows, and knowing Berks’ superiority
of strength, avoided closing whenever he
was able. The whole of the bets depending
on the intended Yorkshire battle were decided
by this contest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tuesday, August 24th, Mr. Fletcher Reid, the pugilistic amateur, gave a
dinner at the One Tun public-house, in St. James’s Market, to a number of
the professors of boxing. Berks was there, and in the evening Belcher
called in, when Mr. Reid addressed Berks, telling him he must now be convinced
it was impossible for him to beat Belcher, and asked him to give him his
hand, which he immediately consented to do, and the two champions sat
down at the same table, and spent the remainder of the day in good humour.
Berks was astonishingly recovered, and said he felt no inconvenience now
from the fight, but being a little stiff. In the course of the evening a
wager was made between him and Jack Warr, Bill’s son, to run one hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>yards, for two guineas, which they immediately decided, and Berks won by
five yards.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Friday, October 8, 1802, James Belcher was carried before his attentive
friend, Nicholas Bond, Esq., and Sir William Parsons, at the Public Office,
Bow Street, being taken into custody on a warrant of Lord Ellenborough’s,
dated the 22nd of July, 1802, in order to give bail for his appearance next
term in the Court of King’s Bench, to answer an indictment found against
him for certain riots and misdemeanours; alluding to the battle he fought
with Berks at Hurley Bottom, in Berkshire, and which had been removed
from the Quarter Sessions to that Court, where it would have rested, as
before understood, had he not lately fought another battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The recognizance was himself in £200, and two sureties in £100 each.</p>

<p class='c007'>This meddling Midas appears to have been one of those public nuisances
that are occasionally entrusted with in-discretionary power. Belcher had
engaged Sadler’s Wells Theatre for the evening of October 26th, 1802, for
his benefit. But Mr. Bond and his brother magistrates disappointed
hundreds, and robbed Belcher, by “closing the house for the season,”
declaring sparring an “unlawful exhibition!” Such are the fantastic tricks
of men “dressed in a little brief authority.”</p>

<p class='c007'>John Firby (the Young Ruffian), who at this time, 1803, stood high in
reputation, offered himself, though certainly stale, as a candidate for “the
Bristol youth’s” favors. A purse of 100 guineas was subscribed by “the
dons of Newmarket race-course,” as the prize; and they were to meet on
Tuesday, April 12th, 1803. But the magistrates of Suffolk and Cambridge
getting wind of the meeting, exerted their authority to prevent it, and on
the Monday evening before, sent notices to the men that a fight would not be
permitted. A secret meeting was immediately held, and it was determined
to repair to the nearest spot in the county of Essex, where they might fight
unmolested by the magistrates. Accordingly, by six o’clock the next
morning, every one in the secret was in bustle, procuring vehicles and
horses for their conveyance. “At seven o’clock Belcher started in a post-chaise,
seated between Joe Ward, his second, and Bill Warr, his bottle-holder.
They pursued the London Road, followed by an immense retinue,
until they arrived at Bone Bridge, where they turned to the left, passed
through Linton, instilling awe into the astonished inhabitants, who could
conceive nothing else but that the French were come. When they had
got to the distance of half-a-mile beyond Linton, and about fifteen from
Newmarket, being in the appointed county, they turned out of the road on
to a level piece of ground, and there resolved to decide the contest. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>prevent a possibility of any interruption it was judged expedient to be as
active as possible. They immediately commenced the formation of a ring,
which was accomplished without much difficulty, there not being many
pedestrians. This being executed, the combatants were called, and informed
that the collection was 100 guineas, but with regard to the terms on which
they contested, they must themselves decide. They immediately agreed 90
guineas for the winner, and 10 for the loser.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The combatants without loss of time began to strip, and after the usual
ceremony, at a quarter past nine, began.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Every countenance expressed
the greatest anxiety, while each stood on his
guard, in expectation of his opponent’s blow.
The disparity in size was considerable, Firby
standing six feet one, and weighing fifteen
stone; Belcher five feet eleven, and barely
twelve stone. The combatants remained inactive
for some seconds, when Firby put in a
blow at the head, which Belcher avoided,
and immediately returned by two blows left
and right, but without much effect; they
closed, and both fell, Belcher underneath.
Many offers to take two to one that “the
Ruffian” would win, but few betters.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Belcher immediately struck Firby in
the mouth, from which blood flowed copiously,
and following it up by a right-handed
blow on the side, brought his antagonist
down. (Odds were now three to one in favour
of Belcher.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—No harm on either side. This round,
Firby at the commencement aimed a blow
at his opponent’s head, which he caught, and
gave a returning blow, which Firby likewise
parried with much dexterity. Belcher again
made a blow which was also stopped; he,
however, made a blow, followed up his opponent
fighting half armed, and Firby fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Both combatants rallied, and both put
in some severe blows. They closed, Belcher
fell, and while on his knees Firby struck
him. A cry of “Foul! foul!” resounded
from all sides. Belcher appealed for a decision
of the point, but wished to go on rather
than take advantage of such a circumstance.
At this time a parson and a constable
arrived from Linton, and endeavoured to
prevent the further progress of the battle;
but the combatants not paying much attention
to the sacred cloth, or the legal staff,
commenced the</p>

<p class='c022'>5th round.—Firby, who now had a black
eye, and spit up blood, shifted, and seemed
afraid to approach his antagonist. Belcher
facetiously beckoned to him, when he came
up and struck, but so slowly, that Belcher
avoided it by a jerk of the head, and while
he was making a violent hit at Firby’s side,
he fell. Belcher smiled; his opponent was
evidently distressed.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—In this round, which undoubtedly was
the best contested throughout the battle, it
became apparent that Belcher’s strength
increased, whilst that of his adversary was
much exhausted. Firby, with much irritability,
made some severe hits at Belcher,
which he, however, either parried or avoided,
so that not one of them told. Belcher
smiled and looked about him with the greatest
composure, even in the heat of the round,
and carefully watching, put in a well directed
blow in the stomach, at the same time closing,
he gave his antagonist a cross buttock
with great violence.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Much hard straight-forward fighting
on both sides, but Firby had the worst of it.
(Odds ten to one on Belcher.)</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Firby rallied, made a hit, which Belcher
stopped with great adroitness, and immediately
struck Firby over the mouth,
cutting his lip severely; Firby, however,
returned it by a sharp hit, but did not draw
blood. (Odds in this round sunk from ten
to five to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—At the first onset Belcher put in a
severe blow over his antagonist’s right eye,
and immediately resuming a defensive attitude,
very cheerfully said, “How do you like
that, Johnny?” Firby made a desperate
blow, but over-reached himself, and fell;
Belcher smiled, and while he was down
pointed at him with great irony.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Belcher followed his opponent round
the ring, and put in some severe blows,
which Firby stopped, but not effectually;
Belcher at length gave him a knock-down
blow, when his friends insisted he should
give in.</p>

<p class='c022'>The contest lasted twenty minutes, during
which time Firby never had any chance of
success. He had ever been considered a
first-rate pugilist, and consequently the
amateurs expected one of the best displays
of science that ever had been witnessed;
but whether Belcher’s name overawed him,
or he really had fallen off in his style of
fighting, he in this contest fell much short
of what was anticipated. Belcher after the
battle had not the mark of a blow perceivable.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Thursday, May 12, 1803.—“Mr. Garrow this day moved for the judgment
of the Court on four defendants, James Belcher, Joseph (but in the indictment
erroneously called Edmund) Burke, Joe Ward, called also erroneously
James, and Henry Lee, who were described to be labourers. These defendants
had allowed judgment to go by default.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The indictment charged, that they, being persons of evil and malicious dispositions,
and fighters, duellers, rioters, etc., had, on the 25th of November, in
the county of Berks, conspired and combined together, that James Belcher
and Edmund Burke (!) should fight a duel, and that the other two defendants
should be aiding and assisting in the said fight and duel; and that in pursuance
of the said conspiracy, the said James Belcher and Edmund Burke unlawfully
and riotously assembled together, with fifty others, to the disturbance
of the public peace; and that Belcher and Burke “fought a duel,” and
the other two “were present, aiding and assisting, together with fifty other
persons.” Mr. Garrow, afterwards a brutal Tory attorney-general and
truculent judge, earned his dirty fee by a more than ordinary amount of
hireling abuse of pugilism. Of course he said little of the deadly weapons
with which the prisoners’ “betters” settled their duels. The celebrated
Erskine, afterwards Lord Chancellor, and Mr. Const defended the prisoners,
merely asking the lenity of the Court. Lord Ellenborough finally bound the
prisoners, each in his own recognizance of £400, to come up when called on
for the judgment of the Court; a nominal judgment, upon which the defendants
were discharged.</p>

<p class='c007'>An unfortunate accident now struck down the skill of this talented boxer,
and clouded his after life in every sense. While playing at rackets with
Mr. Stuart at the Court in Little St. Martin’s Lane, on the 24th of July,
1803, Belcher received a blow from a ball struck by the marker, of such
extraordinary violence as literally to almost knock his eyeball from its
socket. This distressing accident and the heavy recognizance on which he
was bound, had a most depressing effect on Jem’s spirits and health, and he
announced his retirement from the ring. His friends rallied round him, and
placed him in a public-house, the Jolly Brewers, in Wardour Street, Soho,
where he was well supported. But Jem’s spirit was active, though prudence
dictated entire retirement. A quarrel between a brother of Jem’s (who soon
after died) and Hen. Pearce, the Game Chicken, his fellow townsman and
<em>protegé</em>, led to this unfortunate rencontre. The lavish praises too of Pearce’s
friends excited Belcher’s envy: he declared he had taught Pearce all he
knew, and spoke slightingly of “the Chicken’s” ability and skill; but we
are anticipating.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Joe Berks, upon Belcher’s retirement, claimed the championship; but
Pearce of whom we shall soon give the pugilistic career, was invited to
London by Jem, with a promise to procure him patronage and a match with
Berks. These matters will be found hereafter in our Life of <span class='sc'>Pearce</span>, who
had in the interim twice beaten Berks, and subsequently, Elias Spray, Carte,
and lastly John Gully, when Belcher rashly challenged “the Chicken” for
500 guineas, to fight within two months. Pearce appears to have been
much mortified at this challenge, but his position as champion forbade him
to decline it. Mr. Fletcher Reid, Belcher’s firm friend, staked for Jem, and
Captain Halliday posted the 500 for “the Chicken.” This, the first defeat
of the renowned Jem, will be found fully detailed under the memoir of his
conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>Belcher had materially declined in constitution, independently of the loss
of his eye. Among the serious effects of that accident was a nervous depression
and irrepressible irritability, which, according to the testimony of many
who knew him intimately, he tried in vain to control. Upwards of two
years had passed in retirement from active pursuits, and in the ease and free
living of a publican’s calling, when Belcher came forward, upon Pearce’s
claim to the championship, to dispute his title. He could not be persuaded
of the difficulties of meeting so skilful and formidable a boxer with the loss
of an eye; and when too late he discovered his inferiority. How he did
fight was long remembered by those who witnessed the lamentable but truly
heroic and honourable combat, in which more unaffected courage, manly forbearance
and true humanity were displayed and applauded, than ever entered
into the narrow soul of craven slanderers of pugilism to conceive. Animosity
was merged in honourable emulation, and the struggle for fair and unimpeachable
victory. Belcher fought in his accustomed style, and tried his
usual hits with adroit rapidity; but it was noticed that they were often out
of distance, and that his defective eyesight was painfully made evident.
When this was aggravated by blows over the good eye, his aim became
utterly confused, and he became a victim to his own fatuity. Nevertheless,
poor Jem endeavoured to make up for deficiency of sight and aim by an
astonishing and unequalled display of courage and gaiety; and though the
skill and science on both sides deserved respect, the spectators could not
avoid seeing that Belcher’s guard was no longer ready, and his rapid antagonist
planted on him so severely and frequently as to excite the regret of his
friends that such a combat should have been provoked, and that the envious
infirmity of human nature should have thus blinded the mental judgment as
well as the bodily sight of so able a champion. Jem’s spirits, however, never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>forsook him during the fight; and at its close he declared, “That his sorrow
was more occasioned by the recollection of the severe loss of a particular
friend, who, in fact, had sported everything he possessed upon his head, and
had been one of his most staunch backers and supporters through life, than
as to any particular consideration respecting himself!” a generous sentiment
and well worthy of record. Notwithstanding the somewhat ill-natured
remark of John Gully, “That had Jem been in possession of <em>four eyes</em>, he
never could have beaten Pearce,” it must be remembered that the future
M.P. had been thrashed by Pearce, and had not even seen Belcher in his
prime. Fully conceding the excellence evinced by the Chicken in science,
wind, strength, and game, we may yet be allowed the supposition, that had
this contest taken place when Jem Belcher possessed his eyesight in full
perfection, its termination would, to say the least, have been very doubtful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Respecting Belcher’s two battles with Cribb, when the circumstances of
the case are duly appreciated; when it is recollected that his spirits must
have been somewhat damped by previous defeat; and that his powers were
known to be on the decay previous to his fight with the Chicken, it must be
allowed that his heroism and science shone resplendently.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first fight with Cribb, as may be traced, Jem’s superiority in tactics
was manifest. The former was severely punished; and not until Belcher
had received a most violent hit over his good eye, and sprained his right
hand, did Cribb appear to have an opening for a lead. In the seventeenth
round the odds were two to one on Belcher, and in the eighteenth five to one,
when Cribb was so much beaten, that considerable doubts were entertained
whether he would be able to come again; and even at the conclusion of the
battle Cribb was in a very exhausted state. Until Belcher lost his distance,
from his confused sight, victory appeared to hover over him.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the last battle that Belcher fought his courage was principally displayed,
and he by no means proved an easy conquest to Cribb. Since the
loss of his eye, it was the positive wish of his best friends that he should
fight no more, but he was not to be deterred, obstinately neglected good
advice, and would not believe in the decline of his physical powers. In this
last battle, his disadvantages were great. His opponent had made rapid
improvement in science, was in full vigour, and a glutton that was not to be
satisfied in a common way; still Jem gave specimens of his former skill;
but they were rather showy than effective, for the strength had departed.
His hands, too, failed him, and for several of the latter rounds he endeavoured
fruitlessly to prolong the contest without the <em>indispensable</em> weapons to
bring it to a successful issue. Youth, weight, courage, freshness, and no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>mean amount of skill, were too much for the waning stamina and skill of
even a Belcher to bear up against.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of the report of his fight with Firby, a correspondent of the
<cite>Morning Post</cite> thus sketches Belcher’s qualifications from personal acquaintance.
“Belcher is a dashing, genteel young fellow, extremely placid in his
behaviour, and agreeable in his address. He is without any remarkable
appearance of superior bodily strength, but strips remarkably well, displaying
much muscle. Considered merely as a bruiser, I should say he was not so
much a man of science according to the rules of the pugilistic art, as that he
possessed a style peculiar or rather natural to himself, capable of baffling all
regular science, and what appeared self-taught or invented, rather than
acquired by practice. He was remarkably quick, springing backwards and
forwards with the rapidity of lightning. You heard his blows, but did not see
them. At the conclusion of a round his antagonist was struck and bleeding;
but he threw in his hits with such adroitness that you could not discern how
the damage was done. His style was perfectly original, and extremely difficult
to avoid or to withstand.” Again, “His style, like that of the great
masters in every line, was truly ‘his own;’ the spectator was struck with
its neatness and elegance—his opponent confused and terrified by its effects;
while his gravity, coolness, and readiness, utterly disconcerted the fighting
men with whom he was often opposed in mimic as well as actual combat.
Add to this, that a braver boxer never pulled off a shirt, and we need hardly
wonder at his eminent success, until an accident deprived him of one of the
most valuable organs of man’s complex frame.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In his social hours, Jem was good-natured in the extreme, and modest and
unassuming to a degree almost bordering upon bashfulness. In the character
of a publican, no man entertained a better sense of propriety and decorum;
and the stranger, in casually mixing with the Fancy in his house, never felt
any danger of being offended or molested. It would be well if as much
could be said of all sporting publicans.</p>

<p class='c007'>After his last defeat by Cribb, much of Belcher’s fine animal spirits
departed. He was depressed and taciturn, and his health much broken by
twenty-eight days’ imprisonment to which, with a fine, he was condemned
for his breach of the peace by that battle. The old story too, for Jem was
not prudent, is again to be told. His worldly circumstances had suffered
with his health, and</p>

most two of his firmest friends, the once formidable champion departed
this life on Tuesday, July 30, 1811, at the sign of the Coach and Horses,
in Frith Street, Soho, in the thirty-first year of his age, and, on the
following Sunday, was interred in the burial ground of Marylebone. The
concourse of people to witness the funeral was immense; and a more general
sympathy has rarely been witnessed. The proximate cause of his death was
a family complaint, having its origin in an enlargement of the liver. The

<h4 class='c016'>TOM BELCHER—1804‒1822.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c009'><sup>[86]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c013'>The third of the Belchers, Tom, remains in the memory of a few old ’uns
as, for many years, “mine host of the Castle,” a jolly, rubicund, pleasant,
and generous fellow, and the worthy predecessor of the departed Tom Spring,
in that ancient head quarters of the Fancy, now also Pythagorised into a
feeding-shop, named after Sir Charles Napier—another fighting hero. Tom
came to London in the year 1803, when his brother Jem was at the zenith of
his fame, having beaten every man with whom he had fought, and attained
the position of undisputed Champion of England. Although Tom’s ring
career was not so brilliant as his elder brother’s, it had a less striking culmination
and fall, and his thirteen battles, with eight victories and a draw
(with the phenomenon Dutch Sam), tell well for Tom’s descent from the
Slacks and Belchers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Belcher was born at Bristol, in the same house as his brother Jem, on
the 14th of April, 1783. On his earlier years we need not dwell, and where
there is little or no authentic material, we hold nothing in deeper contempt
than the system of “gagging” a parcel of clumsy apocryphal battles, some
of which there is inherent chronological and circumstantial evidence could
never have taken place.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have said Tom came to town at twenty years of age, and he was soon
matched. His first salaam in the ring (which on this occasion was forty feet
in diameter, instead of the customary twenty or twenty-four feet) was on the
26th of June, 1804. His opponent on this occasion was of a noted fighting
stock, being Jack Warr, the son of the celebrated Bill Warr. The prize
contested for was 50 guineas, and—hear it, ye who have in modern times
travelled even to Ireland to see no fight—the battle-ground was no farther
off than Tothill Fields, Westminster; the day, Tuesday, June 26, 1804.</p>

<p class='c007'>Warr was much the firmer set and stouter man, though the youthful Tom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>had the advantage in the reach, and, upon stripping, the odds were a trifle
in favour of Belcher, from the <em>prestige</em> of his family name, and the predilection
of the amateurs for the school from which he came. We quote the contemporary
report.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the Monday night the knowing ones determined that the scene of
action should be Tothill Fields, and on the following day they accordingly
met about two o’clock, attended by their friends. A ring was immediately
formed, not exceeding forty feet in diameter, by driving stakes and attaching
to them the reins lent them by the various hackney coachmen. On stripping,
Warr appeared stouter than Belcher, but the latter was taller and longer in
the reach. After the usual ceremonies they set-to. Odds six to four in
favour of Belcher.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The set-to was in clever style, both displaying excellent science. Warr
put in the first blow and followed it up with a second, both of which took
effect; no return. Had they taken place as aimed their violence might have
settled the battle. Belcher rallied, and some desperate hits were exchanged.
At the conclusion of the round bets became even. From this to the eighth
round both combatants fought desperately. It was a scene of thorough hard
fighting, each endeavouring to make his hits tell, without once shrinking
from the blow of his opponent. Belcher evidently imitated his brother in his
plan of fighting, putting in his blows with his left hand, straight, and with
the rapidity of a dart. Odds rose in favour of Belcher six to four again, but
not from any advantage he had as yet gained in the battle. Warr stood up
manfully, and never once gave way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For the three following rounds Warr put in his blows so forcibly, and so
well directed, that they were almost irresistible, and he undoubtedly had the
advantage. It being considered, however, that Belcher’s bottom was good,
betting did not go lower than par; he, however, at this time displayed great
weakness, and evidently was greatly exhausted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Warr supported the superiority to the sixteenth round, and put in
several desperate body blows. Belcher, on the contrary, fought all at the
head, by which plan Warr’s eyes became greatly affected.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The seventeenth round was most admirably contested. Belcher seemed
to recruit his strength, changed his mode of fighting, and put in successfully
several severe body blows. Warr persevered with undaunted fire throughout
the round; they closed, and both fell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On rising, Warr appeared weak; however, the eighteenth round was
another truly severe trial, both combatants being apparently determined to
exert their greatest strength, and bring into action all their science. Warr
stood his ground, and Belcher put in some severe blows over his eyes, which,
already much cut, were entirely closed at the end of the round.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“Although in this state, Warr obstinately contested another round, in
which he could not fail to be completely worsted. His friends now interfered,
and insisted on his giving in. But he refused; and then fainting, was
immediately carried off the ground almost lifeless, every one complimenting
him by calling him ‘A chip off<a id='t155'></a> the old block.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The nineteen rounds were fought in thirty-three minutes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The son, emulous of the sire, seems at this time to have found favour with
the pugilistic world as with the turf, on an absurd application of the “like
begets like” principle.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c009'><sup>[87]</sup></a> Accordingly, Bill Ryan, son of Michael,<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c009'><sup>[88]</sup></a> was selected
to lower the pretensions of “Young Tom.” The “amateurs” might have done
worse, as the event proved, for Bill polished off the youthful Tom in thirty-eight
rounds, November 30, 1804, as we shall notice in the Appendix to this
Period. (See <span class='sc'>Ryan, Bill</span>, p. 229, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears that Tom was not only dissatisfied with this defeat, but considered
it a “snatched battle.” On Saturday, April 27, 1805, Pearce triumphantly
beat Carte, the Birmingham bruiser (see <span class='sc'>Pearce</span>), at Shepperton
Common, Surrey, in thirty-five minutes. The “fancy” were unsatisfied,
and a subscription purse being collected of 20 guineas, O’Donnel,<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c009'><sup>[89]</sup></a> “the
celebrated Irish hero,” offered himself. Pierce Egan says, “O’Donnel
showed himself entitled to respectful attention; but who was completely
satisfied in fifteen rounds.” The reporter from whom he copies says, in
better English and with more sense, “Tom displayed his known dexterity,
and showed good science; but O’Donnel, who fought well at the commencement,
at the end of the fifteenth round played <em>a cross, and gave in</em>.” We
suspect he was tired of the job.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom fretted, it appears, after the lost laurel with Bill Ryan, and challenged
him a second time to the lists. They accordingly met for 25 guineas
a-side, at Laleham Burway, near Chertsey, Surrey, June 4, 1805. Belcher
was seconded by Tom Blake (Tom Tough), and was backed by Mr. Fletcher
Reid; Bill Ryan was waited on by George Maddox and a “friend.” The
Hon. Berkeley Craven posted his stake, and laid the odds of seven to four on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Ryan. At one o’clock the men stripped, and two to one was offered on
Ryan. We quote the report.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Both men kept at distance;
but after some little sparring Ryan put in
the first blow. Tom parried it extremely
well; Ryan bored in and both fell, Ryan
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Some good straight blows exchanged;
Belcher struck, Ryan parried, and Belcher
fell from the force of his own blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Excellent fighting; as many as ten
blows passed, when Belcher cleanly knocked
down his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Some sharp blows; Ryan threw Belcher
a cross buttock with great violence.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—A tightly contested round; Belcher
fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—No fighting; they closed and both
came down.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—In this round Ryan displayed to advantage,
but closing he fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Very short; Ryan again fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Both having received some desperate
blows, now began to be more cautious,
sparred a good deal, and the round was
terminated rather favourably for Ryan.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Some sharp blows quickly plied.
Belcher fell. (Odds were now generally
two to one on Ryan.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—The men instantly closed, and Ryan
fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—In this round Ryan put in some good
hits and brought down his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Both closed, struggled, and fell, Belcher
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Ryan threw in a severe blow, which
Belcher very scientifically stopped; he
rallied, and both fell with great violence.
When down, Belcher patted Ryan’s cheek,
and said, laughing, “Bill, you’re done over.”</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—No fighting, and the men closed and
fell, Ryan uppermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Both showed fight; Ryan down.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Ryan very adroitly threw his opponent,
still Belcher appeared very gay.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Good fighting. Ryan brought down
his opponent again, but not a clear fall.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—After some good hits exchanged,
Ryan put in a severe blow in the kidneys,
and threw Belcher.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Ryan now appeared distressed in his
wind; but he made a neat hit, but slipped
and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Both fought with great resolution,
and each showed courage. Ryan had the
superiority in strength, and got his opponent
down again.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—Both appeared fatigued; no fighting,
they closed and both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Well contested; Belcher showed good
fight, and his friends began to have a better
opinion of his chance; he hit his man and
got away, Ryan, however, threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Belcher recruited, stood up boldly,
and by an excellent hit, brought down his
opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Both very weak, closed, and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—No fighting, at least no impression.
Ryan fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—Both combatants seemed distressed.
Belcher fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—Belcher at the end of this round fell,
and laughing, fairly pulled his antagonist
after him.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—Belcher immediately on setting to,
put in a blow on the head, and Ryan gave
in, not without a supposition of cross play.
The fight lasted fifty minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Lord Craven, Lord Albemarle, General
Fitzpatrick, Hon. Berkeley Craven, Mr.
Fletcher Reid, Mr. Mellish, Mendoza, Jackson,
Bill Warr, and others were present.”</p>

<p class='c013'>On February the 8th, 1806, Tom was defeated by “the phenomenon,”
Dutch Sam (Elias Samuels). See <span class='sc'>Dutch Sam</span>, Chapter V. of this Period.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the interval between this and his next contest he disposed of an aspirant
(who took the name of “Jack in the Green”) for a ten pound note.</p>

<p class='c007'>His next was a brave but ineffectual attempt to reverse the verdict in the
case of Dutch Sam. Tom, though not <em>quite</em> beaten, fought a draw, July 20,
1807. This led to the final appeal, on August 21, 1807, when Tom’s objections
to Sam’s superiority were finally disposed of. See <span class='sc'>Dutch Sam</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>After these reverses, Dogherty, who had twice beaten Cribb’s younger
brother, George, now challenged Tom, to fight in a month, and the 5th of April,
1803, was fixed for the tourney (the same day as Dutch Sam and Cropley’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>fight was appointed); but it was interrupted by the Bow Street “redbreasts,”
and postponed until Thursday, the 14th of April, when it came off near the
Rubbing House on Epsom Downs. A roped ring of twenty-one feet was
formed on the turf, and about twelve o’clock the combatants entered, Belcher
accompanied by Mendoza and Clark, Dogherty by Cropley and Dick Hall.
Without loss of time they set-to. Six to four on Belcher.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—More than a minute elapsed
before any blows were exchanged, both sparring
to obtain the advantage. Belcher
stopped his opponent’s attempts with great
neatness; a rally took place, when they
closed, but broke away. Some trifling hits
took place; they again closed, and Dogherty
threw Belcher. (The odds six to four were
unchanged.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Belcher stopped a terrible left-hander
which Dogherty aimed at his head; the
latter rushed in, but Belcher knocked him
off his legs.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Skill and courage by no means deficient
on either side. Dogherty tried to
bustle his man, but Belcher was cool and
prepared; he stopped his plunges, and put
in some severe blows on Dogherty’s face,
who, nevertheless, closed the round by
throwing Tom.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—The skill of both men was conspicuous
in this round; but Belcher had the best of
it. Dogherty received a tremendous facer
in endeavouring to plant a hit, and Belcher
in settled in fine style. Dogherty convinced
the spectators that he was no novice, by his
dexterity in stopping—yet Tom, following his
opponent round the ring, punished his head
most terribly, and brought him down by a
blow under the jaw. (Three to one on
Belcher.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Belcher, with uncommon dexterity,
broke through Dogherty’s guard, and with
his left hand planted a most dreadful blow
in his throat, which struck Dogherty so
completely abroad, that he repeated the hit
three times before Dogherty could recover
himself, when they closed and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Belcher upon setting-to dropped his
opponent from the first two blows.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Dogherty’s efforts were completely defensive;
he stopped Belcher’s blows with
great neatness; nevertheless, Belcher rallied
him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Belcher had enough to do in warding
off the well-aimed hits of his adversary, who
now went in impetuously, yet not without
science; in closing, Tom was thrown upon
the ropes by Dogherty, and to all appearance
without difficulty. The betting fell, for
though Dogherty had been hit heavily, he
was strong and dangerous.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Several good blows were exchanged;
but Belcher was not seen to so much advantage
in this round. In closing, Belcher was
underneath.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Belcher sparred cautiously and retreated;
when Dogherty, conceiving something
might be gained by following him, put
in two good hits. In closing the round,
Dogherty was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Belcher put in two facers, when both
the combatants fell out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Dogherty was again thrown, previously
to which Belcher planted two good
hits.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Dogherty, full of pluck, rattled in,
but Tom threw him with considerable force.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Tom, evidently superior in this round,
rendered the bustling of Dogherty unavailing,
and again threw him violently. (Three
and four to one on Belcher.)</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—The game of Dogherty claimed admiration,
his appearance commiseration—his
head was terrific, and his strength was
nearly exhausted; nevertheless, he still
forced the fighting, but his blows were of no
effect, and he fell beneath the superiority of
his opponent. Belcher’s half-arm hits were
as swift as they were punishing, till Dogherty
fell. (Any odds on Belcher.)</p>

<p class='c022'>16 and 17.—In both these rounds the exhaustion
of Dogherty was visible, and, to the
honour of Belcher, be it recorded, he disdained
taking any more advantage than was
necessary to insure his contest: as his opponent
fell on the ropes at his mercy, he walked
away from him. Such humanity ought not
to be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c022'>18 and 19.—Dogherty’s spirits were good,
but his stamina was exhausted; his blows
did not tell, although he still stopped with
considerable science. Belcher kept the lead
in fine style; in closing, both men fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Up to this round it was evident that
Tom must win; but his game opponent was
determined to try every effort while the least
chance remained of success. Tom put in
three desperate facers, and followed them by
so severe a body-blow, that Dogherty fell
quite bent and exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>25‒33.—Dogherty, still determined, contended
for eight more rounds, but was
nothing more than a mere object of punishment
to his opponent, who continually hit
him down with ease. This could not last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>long, and in the thirty-third round, at the
end of forty-five minutes’ sharp fighting,
Belcher was declared the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Belcher was so little hurt,” continues
the reporter, “that upon hearing of his
adversary’s surrender, he immediately threw
a somersault, and ran off to the Rubbing
House (nearly half a mile) without stopping
to put on his clothes. In this battle Belcher
fought with greater skill and science, and
more after the manner of his brother, than
in any one he had contested. His distances
were measured with exactness—every hit
told. Dogherty’s only chance against such
superior skill and steadiness was his sheer
strength and game; but in this last Belcher
showed himself his equal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Bill Richmond, whose memoir will appear hereafter, thrashed a countryman
in the same ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 25th of October, 1808, a day memorable as that whereon Gregson
was beaten after his desperate battle with Tom Cribb at Moulsey, Tom
Belcher entered the same thirty-feet ring to fight Cropley for a purse of
50 guineas. At setting-to the odds were seven to four on Belcher. Cropley
was seconded by Tom Jones; Dick Hall acted as his bottle-holder; and
Belcher was waited on by Mendoza and Dutch Sam. The combatants were
looked upon as well matched, and considerable expectation of a fine display
of the art was entertained. During a contest of thirty-four rounds, which
occupied fifty-six minutes—and it is but justice to observe that a more
scientific fight was rarely seen—Cropley proved himself an excellent boxer,
and possessed of undeniable game. But his attitude was bad; and his defeat
was principally attributed to a knack of bringing his head too forward when
putting in his blows. Belcher saw this advantage, and accepting the present
thus made him, punished his face so dreadfully, that in the latter part of the
battle Cropley was no longer recognizable. Tom’s blows, however, seem to
have been rather more showy than effective, for it was with the utmost difficulty
that Cropley was persuaded to give in, and he was still steady and
strong; though, says the reporter, “all but blind, he even then felt desirous
to try another round.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One Farnborough, who rested his pretensions upon weight, strength, and
pluck, three good points certainly, had the temerity to fight Tom Belcher, on
Epsom race-ground, in a thirty-feet ring, on February 1, 1809. He proved
a mere pretender; and after the first round Belcher treated him with the
utmost <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>. In the course of twenty minutes he so completely polished
him off that Farnborough was glad to cry “enough,” while Belcher was
scarcely touched. This was a small consolation for the Belchers, for in the
same ring on the same day Tom Cribb beat Jem Belcher, as detailed in the
Life of <span class='sc'>Cribb</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Silverthorne, a pugilist of some note and success (see Appendix to Period
IV.), was matched for 100 guineas, and a subscription purse of £50, against
Belcher. This battle was decided upon Crawley Heath, near Copthall, June 6,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>1811. Silverthorne was seconded by the veteran Caleb Baldwin, and his
bottle-holder was Bill Gibbons; Belcher was attended by Mr. John Gully
and Tom Jones. Four to one upon Belcher.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Belcher, upon the alert, stopped
a tremendous body blow, and returned two
sharp hits right and left in Silverthorne’s
face, which immediately produced blood;
after disengaging themselves, Belcher pelted
away most effectually, putting in hits as
quick as lightning. It was declared by
several old ring-goers that such a first
round was never before witnessed. Silverthorne
went down during the hitting from
the severe effects of Belcher’s blows.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Silverthorne came to the scratch with
something more than caution in his attitudes;
he began by retreating from his adversary,
who hit him right and left upon the head.
Silverthorne, in planting a hit upon Belcher’s
throat, was stopped; nevertheless he got in
a severe body blow, which Belcher retaliated
by hitting him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Silverthorne, who bled profusely,
rattled in, game as a pebble, but without
effect—Belcher put in several severe blows.
Silverthorne showed he was not without
science by stopping several nasty ones;
Belcher losing his distance closed, and was
thrown by Silverthorne.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—It was now evident that Silverthorne
was much inferior to his opponent, who
frustrated all his attempts with ease and
coolness. Silverthorne endeavoured to plant
a severe body blow, which Tom stopped,
when a rally commenced, which turned out
to Belcher’s advantage, for he put in a
terrible blow, then closed, and threw his
opponent a cross-buttock enough to knock
the breath out of him.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Silverthorne came to the scratch anything
but improved in appearance; he
received two facers, and fell in an attempt
to get in. (All betters but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Notwithstanding the chance was
against him, Silverthorne showed play, and
stopped very neatly a right-handed blow
which was intended for his head. Belcher,
however, got in one on the body, and Silverthorne
fell in attempting to return the hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—It was now bellows to mend with
Silverthorne, who was completely exhausted,
but still wished to try another chance—Belcher
did as he liked with him, and finished
the contest by a hit in the throat, which
knocked him down. The game Silverthorne
could come no more, and Belcher was proclaimed
the conqueror. Silverthorne was
at once conveyed to a post-chaise, carried to
the nearest inn, and put to bed. Belcher,
as on a former occasion, threw a somersault,
then mounted the box of a patron’s barouche,
and started for town.</p>

<p class='c022'>“In this battle Belcher had as fine an
opportunity, despite Silverthorne’s experience,
of showing off his superior science, as
with the slow and unwieldy Farnborough.
He fought cautiously, drawing his opponent,
when he never had any difficulty in getting
on to him. Silverthorne was beaten in spirit
in the first round, though he did not give in
till nature deserted him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>After this triumph Belcher reposed awhile on his laurels; and in the early
part of 1813 he started on a sparring tour through the provinces, visiting the
northern parts of the island. In Liverpool he was particularly attractive,
and numerous pupils attended his school, who, from their rapid progress in
the science, gave proofs of the excellence of the master under whom they
studied. His engagement being completed at this seaport, and being so near
to the “tight boys of the sod,” he determined, previous to his return to the
metropolis, to take a peep at “the land that gave Paddy his birth.” Tom’s
arrival in Ireland, while it gave pleasure to the patrons of the science,
created jealousy in another professor of boxing, who had been there some
time previous, teaching the natives the advantages of the complete use of
their fives, an art never properly understood or appreciated by Irishmen.
Dogherty resented Tom’s visit as a sort of intrusion on his domain; added to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>which his scholars ran after the newly arrived “Sassenach.” This was
unendurable. Dogherty issued a cartel to his former conqueror, and all other
preliminaries being arranged, the rivals met on the Curragh of Kildare, on
Friday, the 23rd of April, 1813, for a subscription purse of 100 guineas, and
“the honour of ould Ireland,” as the “historian” expresses it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spot where the fight took place, known to this day as “Belcher’s
Valley,” was particularly convenient for spectators, being in a glen on
the Curragh, surrounded by sloping hills, forming a natural amphitheatre.</p>

<p class='c007'>Belcher appeared first in the enclosure, dressed in a great coat, but, whilst
it was completing, retired to a barouche, in which he had arrived. Dogherty
now showed himself to the spectators, wrapped up in a box-coat of no trifling
dimensions, and instantly gave his caster a toss in the air, loudly vociferating,
“Ireland for ever.” This sentence, which came so directly home to the
natives of Paddy’s Land, occasioned an electric expression of approbation
from the surrounding multitude, accompanied by repeated shouts and huzzas.
It might spontaneously have escaped the lips of Dogherty, from a warmth of
feeling to his native soil, but it certainly was not calculated to place Belcher
in a favourable point of view with the assembled multitude. Tom accordingly
again entered the enclosure, seeming to feel (whatever the intention of it
might be toward him) that, if suffered to pass over without notice, it might
operate to his prejudice. After bowing to the spectators, he solicited a
gentleman who had been chosen the umpire to address the public, that no
improper impression might go forth respecting his character. This the gentleman
did, nearly to the following effect:—“Gentlemen, Mr. Belcher
wishes it to be understood that, if any aspersions have been levelled at him,
stating that he has spoken disrespectfully of the Irish nation, he begs leave to
assure you it is an absolute falsehood; and, as a proof of the truth of his statement,
he is ready at any time to fight those who may dare assert to the contrary.”
This pithy oration was favourably received; the combatants immediately
stripped, and the ceremony of shaking hands having been gone through, the
seconds took their stations. Isle of Wight Hall seconded Belcher, and
Gamble attended upon Dogherty. Belcher, from his well-known excellence,
was the favourite, two to one, yet, notwithstanding this great odds, there
were scarcely any takers. Both the combatants appeared to possess confidence
in themselves. Belcher having beaten Dogherty in England, felt that
superiority which belongs to experience and practical knowledge. On the
other hand, Dogherty was considerably improved, and for “the honour of
Ireland,” and surrounded by his countrymen, felt an additional stimulus to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>win, and was determined not to yield the palm so long as he could struggle
for it. With these feelings they set-to exactly at one o’clock.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The excellent attitude and
neatness of style exhibited by Belcher, much
attracted the attention of the Irish amateurs.
Good science on both sides, when they both
hit together; Dogherty received a sharp
facer, and the blood issuing from his lip,
Belcher exclaimed, “First blood,” several
bets depending upon that event. Belcher
received Dogherty’s return upon the ear.
Some severe hits were exchanged, and, in
closing, both went down, but Belcher undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Both combatants went sharply to work,
and much good fighting was displayed. In
closing, Belcher was thrown, but received no
injury from his fall. Loud shouting occurred,
and Dogherty was so elated with his
dexterity, that in the pride of the moment,
he offered 100 to 10, but it received no
attention.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Some excellent sparring opened the
round, in which Dogherty showed that he
was much improved since his former contest
at Epsom; it was followed by the exchange
of several severe blows. Dogherty’s mug
was rather pinked, his temper seemed a
little ruffled, and the round was concluded
by his being thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Milling without ceremony was the
order of the day; but the advantage was
on the side of Belcher, from his superior
science: he hit much more rapidly than his
opponent, and his defensive tactics displayed
a like superiority; he punished the face of
his opponent terribly, and finally sent Dogherty
down by a one, two, right and left.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Caution became rather necessary on
the part of Dogherty. Belcher was thrown,
but not before some severe hits had been
exchanged.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Belcher punished the nob of his antagonist
throughout this round. They closed
and both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—The combatants made play, when an
opening appearing, Belcher put in so severe
a hit on Dogherty’s ribs that he reeled down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The contrast between the styles of the
two pugilists at that early period of the
battle was manifest to all the spectators.
Dogherty had been most terribly punished.
His face was materially altered, one of his
eyes being closed; the claret trickled from
his olfactories and potato trap, and the
round was terminated by Dogherty’s receiving
so severe a hit upon the thorax that he
instantly went down. (Belcher a guinea to
a shilling!)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—The game of Dogherty deserves peculiar
notice, from the sharp milling he took
without flinching; Belcher serving it out so
hard and fast as to knock him down. In
going over him, Belcher disengaged himself
from Dogherty in neat style.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Belcher full of gaiety showed his
leading superiority by planting several hits;
notwithstanding, in closing, Dogherty threw
him.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—The combatants were determined to
convince the lookers on there was no trifling
between them; both milling away in every
direction. The left eye of Belcher received
an ugly blow, and Dogherty, still strong,
threw him under the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Fighting without intermission, and
bravery truly conspicuous on both sides. The
round was terminated by Belcher putting in
a tremendous teaser on Dogherty’s throat,
which not only floored him, but rendered
him unable to move for a few seconds.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Belcher held the advantage by
punishing the face of Dogherty dreadfully,
and ended the round by knocking him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—No alteration. Dogherty rather
groggy, and Belcher getting second wind;
still taking the lead in milling, and closing
the round by throwing Dogherty, and falling
upon him.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—The game of the latter was the theme
of every one. He proved himself a perfect
trump, rallying with good spirit, but receiving
a straight hit under the eye, he went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—On setting-to Dogherty made play,
but the judgment of Belcher foiled him; the
latter putting in several blows in succession,
fibbing him, and ending by throwing his
man cleverly.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Dogherty planted some severe body
blows; nevertheless, Belcher closed and
threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—A smart rally, both men keeping up
the game gaily. Belcher, in endeavouring
to throw his antagonist, went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Dogherty sparred with considerable
judgment, to gain time, and put in a sharp
blow upon the body of Belcher, who went
down from a slip.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Belcher seemed perfectly at home;
as if he felt convinced how things were
going. The advantage of superior science,
enabled him to serve out Dogherty about the
head with such severity as to occasion the
latter to fall at his feet. (A bet could not
be obtained at any odds.)</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Dogherty, still at the scratch, contended
with the utmost bravery to prolong
the fight, but it appeared only to receive
additional punishment. His head and face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>exhibited a rueful aspect—he was covered
with claret, and in the event milled to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—To the astonishment of every one
present, the spirit of Dogherty was not
broken. He attempted to put in some good
hits upon the body of Belcher, but the wary
guard of Tom stopped them with ease; in
throwing Dogherty, he went down with him.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Punishment was the lot of Dogherty,
and his face and neck were terribly mauled;
but in closing, he showed his strength by
throwing Tom on his hip.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Manœuvring again resorted to. Dogherty
felt for Belcher’s body; but Tom returned
the favour most liberally on his
opponent’s mug. In closing, Dogherty experienced
so severe a fall, as to remain a
short period insensible.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—The pluck of Dogherty was not yet
taken out of him, and whilst he entertained
the smallest notion of a chance remaining,
he was determined to stand up, although so
dreadfully worsted every round. A desperate
hit from Belcher again made him
measure his length on the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>26 and last.—Dogherty, with the most
determined resolution, endeavoured to rise
superior to exhausted nature, and would not
cry “enough!” He made a desperate rally
to effect a change in his favour, evincing
that no common caterer could satisfy his
inordinate gluttony. Belcher, however, hit
him almost where he pleased, and wound up
the piece by throwing and falling on him.
Dogherty could not come again; he was
decidedly finished; and some time elapsed
before he could get up. He was bled in
both arms upon the ground, and instantly
conveyed home and put to bed.</p>

<p class='c022'>This well-contested fight continued thirty-five
minutes, and upon Belcher’s being declared
the conqueror, he threw a somersault,
and immediately got into a barouche and
drove off to Dublin to a dinner provided for
him by a party of gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c022'>If this distinguished boxer claimed the
admiration of the spectators from the scientific
manner in which he won the battle, and
the superior adroitness he displayed in protecting
himself from scarcely receiving any
injury, it is but justice to observe, that Dan
Dogherty proved himself a milling hero of
the first stamp; and the true courage he
displayed ought not to be forgotten. As a
proof that his efforts made considerable impression,
a subscription, amounting to upwards
of £70, was immediately made for
him, the Marquis of Sligo putting down
5 guineas; to this Belcher subscribed a
guinea. Tom continued several months
after this battle in Ireland, exhibiting specimens
of his skill, in company with Hall,
with increased reputation and success. At
Cork and Dublin his well-earned fame produced
him numerous respectable scholars,
among whom several persons of rank were
conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c022'>The advantages of superior science were
never more clearly shown, than in this combat.
The dexterity, ease, and perfect <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang
froid</span></i> with which Belcher defeated Dogherty
surprised even those who were somewhat
acquainted with the art, but, generally
speaking, among the mere lookers on it
excited astonishment—to view one man (and
a scientific professor too) hit all to pieces,
his head so transmogrified that few traces
of his former phiz remained, completely
doubled up, and perfectly insensible to his
defeat; while the other combatant was seen
retiring from the contest with barely a
scratch, and driving away from the Curragh
with all the gaiety of a spectator. It was
impossible that such a vast superiority could
be passed without remark.</p>

<p class='c013'>On Belcher’s return to England, he took a benefit at the Fives Court
(May 20, 1814), which was numerously patronised, preparatory to his commencing
tavern keeper, at the Castle, in Holborn, previously in the occupation
of Gregson, afterwards the caravansera of the respected Tom Spring; and here
we must make room for a slight anecdote recorded by Pierce Egan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tom, in company with Shelton, about a week after he had defeated
Dogherty, upon coming down Highgate Hill, in a chaise, was challenged to
have a trotting match, by a couple of fellows in a gig. Belcher endeavoured
to give them the go-by, but they kept continually crossing him. At length,
one of those heroes, determined upon kicking up a row, jumped out of his
chaise, and without further ceremony, seized Tom by the leg, in order to pull
him out to fight, threatening, at the same time, to mill both Belcher and
Shelton.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“‘Let go,’ said Tom, ‘and as soon as I get upon the ground, we will have
a fair trial, depend upon it.’—One of Belcher’s fingers, at this period, was in
a poultice, and his hand so sore that he could scarcely touch anything with
it; however, this did not prevent the turn up from taking place. The cove’s
nob was metamorphosed in a twinkling, and, by way of a finisher, he received
a blow that sent him rolling down the hill, to the no small diversion of
Shelton and Tom. The latter now mounted his gig with all the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>
possible, good-naturedly advising this would be fighting man never to
threaten, in future, beating two persons at once. Upon the blade’s stopping
at the nearest inn to clean his face from the claret it was deluged with, he
learnt, to his great surprise, he had been engaged with the celebrated Tom
Belcher.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Belcher, whose desire for punishing his opponents always ceased on
quitting the prize-ring, was attacked one evening, in June, 1817, upon his
entering a genteel parlour in the vicinity of Holborn, in a most unhandsome
manner, by Jack Firby (a fifteen stone man, and six feet high, but better
known by the appellation of the Young Ruffian, and from his defeat by Jem
Belcher). In spite of all his ruffianism and knowledge of boxing, his nob
was instantly placed in chancery—his peepers were taken measure of for
a suit of mourning—and his mug exhibited all the high vermilion touches of
colouring, without the aid of a painter. In a few minutes he was so completely
satisfied, from the celerity of his expert opponent, as scarcely to be
able to retire, covered with shame and confusion for his insolence. Tom
politely expressed himself sorry for the trifling interruption the company
had experienced, without receiving the slightest scratch from his overgrown
bully.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In conclusion, we may take a glance at Belcher as the “retired pugilist,”
a character which, in our own time, we have seen a sufficiency of examples
to respect, despite the libels and lies of “Craven” and other calumniators.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not to cite bygone landlords of “The Castle,” in themselves a tower
of strength, we may mention that one pugilist (Mr. John Gully) whose
memoir will appear in an early chapter, has risen to senatorial honours;
another (Langan, the antagonist of Spring), received a piece of plate (on his
retirement from business with a handsome fortune), as a testimonial of the
high respect of his neighbours and acquaintance in the town of Liverpool;
while the best conducted sporting houses, and those which least frequently
figure before magistrates, are—we fearlessly assert it—those kept by ex-pugilists
of the higher caste. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Teste</span></i> Belcher’s, Spring’s, Jem Burn’s, Owen
Swift’s, in London, and many sporting houses in the provinces. There are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>exceptions, of course, but if the slanderers of pugilists and fair pugilism will
insist on descending to personal or individual libel, to bolster up their
cowardly onslaughts on this manly art, we pledge ourselves for every
pugilist of note, whose name they produce as having come under the lash
of the law for any dishonourable offence, to pick out a parson, a magistrate,
or a doctor to match him; and if the highest criminality be the test of class
profligacy and brutality, we will go higher and find them Quakers, military
officers, aye, even bishops, guilty of capital felony. Truly it is enough to
make one’s blood boil to read such canting drivel, such impotent spleen
vented on bravery and courageous endurance. For ourselves, some acquaintance
with the world has taught us that we had rather trust to the honour and
generosity of a soldier than a priest, or a pugilist than a professing puritan.
But to return to Belcher.</p>

<p class='c007'>For several years Tom was a frequent exhibitor at the Tennis Court, where
no boxer more decisively established the superiority of art over strength.
The following instance may tend, in some degree, to illustrate the above
opinion. Ikey Pig, the antagonist of Cribb, who possessed a smattering
of the science, was not only knocked about like a child, but ultimately hit
clean off the stage. Shaw, the life-guardsman, a Hercules in appearance,
a man of undeniable courage, and with strength to match his mighty heart,
was dead-beat with the gloves by Tom; although this son of Mars, but a day
or two before, in a bout with Captain Barclay, had put the captain’s upper
works to much confusion, and made his teeth chatter again. Gully, whose
knowledge of boxing was far above mediocrity, appeared considerably inferior
in his sets-to with Tom. Molineaux, too, when in his prime, was milled in
all directions over the stage, and ultimately floored by Belcher. During the
time Tom was in training at Norwich to fight with Farnborough, in an
exhibition of sparring at the above place, he levelled the Champion Cribb,
to the no small surprise of the spectators. The memorable disposal of Shock
Jem (a lad of most determined spirit, and who had made the art of self-defence
his study, under the tuition of the scientific George Head), was so
complete and satisfactory upon the point in question by Belcher, as to need
no further comment. Shock was “hit to pieces.” In competition with
Cribb or any of the “big ones,” Tom’s excellence as a sparrer was never
in the slightest degree doubtful; and of this a marked demonstration took
place on the occasion of Cribb’s benefit, May 31, 1814. The massive bulky
appearance of the champion standing over the compact elegant form of
Belcher, reminded the spectator not inaptly of the difference between a small
frigate contending with a first-rate man-of-war; and that however the former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>might, from its compact size and high state of discipline, perform its movements
with greater celerity, and even create considerable annoyance by
superiority of tactics, yet ultimately, in a decisive engagement, where there
was no room for manœuvring, it must strike to heavier metal. So with these
combatants. The ponderosity of Cribb, when in close quarters with his
opponent, or he bored in upon him, was manifest; but when at arm’s length,
and while there remained room for a display of adroitness and skill, Belcher
appeared the greater man. The exclamations, which made the court resound
again, with “well done, little Tom,” decided this point. Belcher put in
some neat touches upon the nob of the Champion, on his resolutely boring in,
and stopped, in several instances, the well-meant heavy blows of Cribb in the
return, with considerable dexterity and judgment. True, when the Champion
did get in, he drove Belcher to the corner of the stage, and the strength and
resolution of Cribb prevailed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In concluding our remarks on Belcher’s sparring, the following circumstance
is worthy of note. It occurred on the 26th of February, 1817, at the
benefit of Cribb. Upon Belcher ascending the stage with H. Lancaster, they
were interrupted from all parts of the court, with the cry of “Scroggins.”
Mr. Jackson also requested it, for the satisfaction of several amateurs of rank
present. Upon this, that hardy little hero appeared, and Lancaster retired.
The spectators were uncommonly anxious to witness this set-to, which might
be denominated first-rate science against the most determined ruffianism.
Scroggins, immediately on shaking hands with his opponent, rushed at him
with all the impetuosity of an English bull-dog, and, for three rounds, it was
a downright mill with the gloves. Belcher, from the fury of his antagonist,
was driven more than once against the rails, and from want of room his
science seemed somewhat at a discount. In the fourth, however, Tom began
to feel his way with more certainty, faced his opponent sharply with his
one-two, on his boring in, and had the best of the round, when Scroggins
bowed and took off the gloves; and, although loudly and repeatedly solicited
by the spectators to have another round, and particularly by Belcher, he
immediately quitted the stage. A slight tint of the claret appeared on both
their mugs, but was first visible from the mouth of Scroggins.</p>

<p class='c007'>This little episode, with a man of Scroggins’s character, might reasonably
be expected to result in something like a trial without the mufflers, and so it
eventually proved. For on the 10th April, 1822, a sporting dinner having
taken place at the Castle, Scroggins, who was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bacchi plenis</span>, got into a
“skrimmage” with Belcher. The little hero would not be denied, and Tom
feeling his character for courage touched, cast aside the counsel of discretion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>and a mill took place. Twenty minutes ruffianing, boring in, and hard
fighting on one side, and scientific administration of punishment on the
other, settled the question, and Scroggins was forced to give in. This was a
gratuitous and somewhat ill-advised exhibition on the part of Belcher, who
needed no such triumph, yet it showed the spirit of the “old war-horse ready
for the fray,” was still within him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Belcher was in height about five feet nine inches, weighing nearly
eleven stone. His appearance was gentlemanly, and his manners and deportment
of the most mild and inoffensive nature, well calculated to prepossess the
stranger in his favour; who also found in his company the perfection of the
pugilist, unmingled with the coarseness which the ignorant and the prejudiced
are too apt to associate with their ideal of every brave boxer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Belcher died at Bristol on the 9th of December, 1854, aged 71 years,
universally respected.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>HEN. (OR HENRY) PEARCE, “THE GAME CHICKEN” (CHAMPION)—1803‒1805.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Brilliant as a meteor Hen. Pearce shot across the pugilistic horizon,
as quickly to fall extinguished. When Jem Belcher had reached the zenith
of his fame, he cast his eyes toward Bristol for a successor, and the early
reputation of Pearce pointed him out as a likely holder of the belt of championship
on behalf of his own native city.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall not here dilate on the fistic capabilities of Pearce, convinced that
a simple record of his deeds will far outweigh pompous panegyric and fulsome
laudation. Pearce was another among the many scientific sons of boxing
Bristol, and among the many ring recruits which that ancient city furnished
to the metropolitan arena must ever hold a distinguished place.</p>

<p class='c007'>The year of Pearce’s birth was 1777, and after serving his apprenticeship
duly to the age of twenty-one, to a tradesman in Bristol, some of the
cognoscenti were attracted by his remarkable skill in sparring, and in boxing
matches, for which that city and its rival, Bath, were then famous.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Jem Belcher’s accident, in July, 1803, the champion made a
flattering overture to the young Bristolian<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c009'><sup>[90]</sup></a> to come to London. Berks,
as we have already observed, now asserted his title to the championship, and
Jem soon found Pearce an introduction to that bumptious personage, who
was as much a bully as a bruiser, at the well-known rendezvous in St.
Martin’s Street, Leicester-square. Belcher, as might be expected, after
himself testing Pearce’s qualifications, readily backed his townsman, and
their first serious rencontre is thus told in “Pancratia,” pp. 182 et seq.:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thursday, August 11, 1803, was a great day out with the sporting
classes of the metropolis, and ‘the Chicken’ was there (at Shooter’s Hill)
with other visitors. Joe Berks also was present. On the road home these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>already talked-of rivals for the championship eyed each other with minute
attention, and doubtless with some feelings of envy. In the course of the
evening they met again at the Fives Court, St. Martin’s Lane, and stories
were industriously circulated of the utter contempt which each had formed
for the other’s pugilistic powers. In the course of the evening Pearce having
retired, the gluttonous butcher became offensively insolent towards Pearce’s
friends, boasting his capability of making it an affair of a few minutes, with
such a thread paper. The challenge was communicated to the Chicken, who
rose with alacrity from his bed (he then lodged in Wardour-street, Soho),
and everything was quickly got ready. A well-lighted room was selected,
and notice sent round to some leading patrons, that a trial of skill was to take
place between the new Bristol youth, and the celebrated glutton Berks;
numbers soon assembled, and between the hours of eleven and twelve the
battle commenced. Berks’ inferiority was soon manifest. His slow and
round method of fighting failed in doing any execution when opposed to
the straight rapid hits of his active adversary, and his pluck only enabled
him to receive uncommon punishment. The Chicken lost no time in displaying
the graces of the science, yet put in his blows so sharply that Berks
soon exhibited signs of weakness. During a desperate contest of twenty
minutes, in which fifteen rounds of tremendous milling took place, Berks
evinced great courage, and endeavoured in the latter round to fight defensively,
and parry the blows of the Chicken, but the latter followed him up so
straight-forward, that it was impossible for Berks to resist the consequences,
and he was twice floored by the Chicken, so decidedly that he lay stupefied.
The two blows were allowed by all present, to have been the most tremendously
effective they had ever witnessed. Berks was dreadfully milled, yet
had the candour to acknowledge that he had never before met with such a
rapid antagonist.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be observed that the cause of this unusual mode of settling
an important fight, was that Berks was at this time under recognizances
of £200, and the conditions of a published prize-fight were supposed to be
hereby evaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the time “the Game Chicken” first appeared in London, the patrons
of the pugilate felt desirous to match him regularly against Berks, but the
latter’s recognizances proved an insurmountable obstacle. Time at length
eradicated all fear of that process, and the match was made.</p>

<p>HEN. (<span class='fss'>OR</span> HENRY) PEARCE (<span class='sc'>Champion</span>), “THE GAME CHICKEN.”<br /><br /><em>From a Drawing by</em> <span class='sc'>Reeves</span>, of Bristol, 1805.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>The sum staked was £100, and the combatants agreed to fight upon the
terms of £90 to the winner, and £10 to be appropriated to the loser.
Accordingly “on Monday, January 23, 1804, the heroes of the fist again
graced the well-known spot on Wimbledon Common, and at eleven o’clock
a ring was formed upon the highest part of the common near Coombe Wood;
but receiving information that they were in a parish wherein they were
liable to be molested, they immediately gave the word to form another near
the telegraph. A race ensued of a curious description, some thousands of
pedestrians and equestrians, with lots of carriages and carts, all were
set in commotion, trying who should obtain the best situation for seeing
the fight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A ring being formed, after the bustle had subsided, Berks entered,
accompanied by Tom Owen for his second, and Paddington Jones his bottle-holder.
Shortly afterwards Pearce appeared, attended by Bill Gibbons and
Caleb Baldwin. They immediately began to strip; Berks was the tallest
and displaying immense muscle appeared to possess uncommon strength.
Pearce stood about five feet eight inches and three quarters; the conformation
of his chest and limbs brought to recollection the athletic form of the noted
Tom Johnson, but on a smaller and lighter scale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At precisely at eleven minutes before twelve they set to. Odds seven to
four in favour of Pearce, from the former rencontre.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Pearce showed great caution,
opposing himself indirectly to superior
strength; and Berks had learnt from the
brushing he had got at St. Martin’s Lane,
not to rush in. Without any blows being
exchanged, both men closed and fell. (Two
to one on Pearce.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The Shropshireman upon his mettle,
game to the back-bone, went in desperately,
and fought into a rally like a hero; but the
Chicken, awake to his intent, milled on the
retreat, and at length put in a stopper on
Berks’ forehead, that made him reel again,
when the Chicken caught him staggering,
and threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Berks, though bleeding profusely,
stood up well to his man, and a good display
of hits was made on both sides. Berks
again thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>4, 5.—Ditto repeated, the exchanges in
favour of the Chicken.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Pearce put in a blow, which Berks
countered so heavily as to bring down Pearce
on his knee. (Bravo, Berks!)</p>

<p class='c022'>7 to 11.—Berks exceedingly shy of his
opponent, always waiting for his antagonist
to break ground, and suffering much from
the repetition of his blows. From this to</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—The Chicken so much the favourite,
that the odds were four to one upon him.
It was manifest that Berks was not a match
for his man. His style of fighting was considerably
inferior to that of his opponent’s,
and he began to appear much distressed;
he occasionally tried to affect the scientific
style of his opponent, but at a still greater
disadvantage than his own natural mode of
fighting. The severe blows he received from
the Chicken made him unruly and intemperate,
and he was becoming fast an easy
conquest up to the</p>

<p class='c022'>20th round.—Berks’ passion was now exhausting
his strength. His nose bleeding
considerably, and, irritated in mind that no
chance offered of proving successful, he ran
in furiously upon his opponent. His intemperance
rendered him a complete object for
punishment, and the Chicken milled him in
every direction. (Twenty to one the winner
is named; and even bets that Berks don’t
come again.)</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Passion uppermost; Berks desperate
in the extreme, and by running in headlong,
missed putting in a hit, and fell. Pearce
smiling at his want of prudence, and holding
up both his hands in triumph.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—A good rally, but Berks received a
most tremendous floorer.</p>

<p class='c022'>24 and last.—Berks still insensible to prudence,
and determined to get at his man,
received a severe milling. He was several
times advised by his backers and seconds to
give in, but resolutely refused, soliciting
each time to “fight another round.” However,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>at the close of the twenty-fourth bout,
he was hit down stupefied, but suddenly
recovering, gave in. The battle lasted one
hour and seventeen minutes, and Berks, we
had almost said as usual, was severely
punished. Pearce fought the last round as
gaily as the first, and when it was over
challenged Isaac Bittoon<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c009'><sup>[91]</sup></a> for 200 guineas,
but this match went off.</p>

<p class='c013'>After this battle Maddox beat Seabrook in three rounds, and the afterwards
well-known Bill Richmond in three more.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a little <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">désagrément</span></i><a id='t170'></a> arising out of this “field day.” Tom Owen
was indicted at the ensuing Surrey Sessions, for a “riot and conspiracy,”
in seconding Berks, in a pitched battle on Wimbledon Common, and refusing
to depart when warned by a warrant officer, sent by Mr. Conant, the
magistrate, upon information laid. Tom was sentenced to three months’
imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elias Spray, the coppersmith, a boxer of renown in the neighbourhood
of Bristol, and who had twice beaten Bill Jackling (Ginger), the brother
of Tom Johnson, the champion, was next selected to try the mettle of
our hero.</p>

<p class='c007'>Monday, March 11, 1805, was the day appointed, and the fixture was
Hampton Court; but fearing an interruption, they agreed to cross the water,
and decide the contest upon Molesworth (Moulsey) Meadow. Considerable
confusion took place in procuring boats to convey the numerous followers
across the river, where several not only experienced a good ducking, but some
narrowly escaped drowning, in their eagerness to reach the destined spot.
At length, everything being completed, Pearce, attended by Maddox and
Hall, as his second and bottle-holder, entered the ring (twenty feet square)
and threw up his hat in defiance. Spray soon made his appearance, followed
by Wood as his second, and Mountain as bottle-holder. Betting was seven
to four on Pearce, even that the fight did not last twenty-five minutes, and
ten to one that Pearce was not beaten in half an hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The combatants lost no time in stripping, and after shaking hands
smilingly set-to at a little before one o’clock.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c009'><sup>[92]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—A little sparring; Spray made
a short hit; the Chicken put in a severe
blow and brought down his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Good blows exchanged. Spray put in
a blow in his antagonist’s breast. Pearce
rallied, and again knocked Spray down.
(Odds nine to four in favour of the Chicken.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The Coppersmith showed good courage,
and fought well. The men closed, and both
fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Spray rather hastily made some hard
blows, but they failed. Pearce gave him a
cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—In this round Spray already appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>distressed. The Chicken showed excellent
science, and a third time completely knocked
down his opponent. As he fell, Pearce
smiled.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Both fought well; some sharp blows
exchanged. Spray struck his opponent in
the stomach. Pearce rallied, and threw
him very cleverly.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Pearce seemed much affected by
Spray’s last blow in the bread-basket. He
made a hit, but failed, and fell. (Odds fell
to two to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—No good blows, but Pearce again had
the advantage the whole of these four rounds.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Spray put in some good determined
blows, but they mostly fell short; at length,
by a successful blow on the nose, he brought
down the Chicken.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Pearce bled profusely. Spray evinced
weakness, made a short blow, and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Pearce met his antagonist with determined
resolution, and put in so severe a
blow on the jaw, that every one feared lest
he had broken it; Spray fell. (Odds now
rose ten to one on Pearce.)</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Spray stood up to his man boldly,
but quickly received a floorer from the
Chicken.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Courage displayed on both sides.
Spray put in some well directed hits; but in
closing, Pearce threw him a cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Spray attempted to rally, but received
a most desperate blow upon his temple that
nearly deprived him of his recollection, and
which spoilt him for the remainder of the
fight. The ensuing five rounds upon the
part of Spray were little better than mere
exhibitions of animal courage.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—All in favour of the Chicken. (Twenty
to one, but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Spray again showed himself, but his
efforts to turn the tide were futile. The
Chicken smiled at his attempts; yet the
Coppersmith showed considerable skill, and
continued the battle to</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—Hardly to be called fighting. Spray
was down as soon as he appeared.</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—Spray could scarcely stand, yet could
not bring himself to say “No.” He put up
his hands and endeavoured to face his opponent.
It was all up: the Chicken hit him
as he liked, and finally knocked him off his
legs.</p>

<p class='c022'>29 and last.—Spray stood up, but only to
exhibit the spectacle of a game man struggling
against fate. Pearce put in a thrust
rather than a blow, and poor Spray was persuaded
to give in. The battle lasted thirty-five
minutes. Pearce immediately sprang
over the ropes, laid down on the grass for a
few minutes, during which he accepted a
challenge from Carte, the Birmingham
“champion,” for 50 guineas. The money
was immediately staked, and they agreed to
fight within six weeks. The Chicken then
started for town in a chaise, full of spirits.</p>

<p class='c013'>On Saturday, the 27th April, 1805, the day appointed for Carte to enter
the lists with the Chicken, the parties met at Shepperton Common, near
Chertsey, in Surrey. The superiority of the Chicken was so manifest, that
Carte had not the least chance whatever, although six feet three and a half
inches in height, and weighing upwards of fifteen stone. It would be a waste
of time and paper to give the rounds in the detail. Suffice it to observe, that
after a contest of thirty-five minutes, in which twenty-five rounds took place,
Carte, from his ignorance of the art, received a most terrible milling; while,
on the contrary, the science of the Chicken so protected him from the attacks
of his adversary, that he scarcely had a mark visible.</p>

<p class='c007'>A new, young, and formidable rival now sought the notice of Pearce.
This was the afterwards celebrated John Gully,<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c009'><sup>[93]</sup></a> then a young man of
twenty-one years of age: as we prefer the chronicler’s account where his
details are available, we quote a contemporary journalist:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Henry Pearce, the Game Chicken, by the unprecedented adroitness and
success with which he has contested every combatant matched against him,
in London, has acquired, with almost universal assent, the proud title of
Champion of England. It has ever been found, throughout the annals of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>pugilism, that whenever any hero has, however meritoriously, acquired such
a flattering distinction, some emulous aspirant has sprung up to dispute his
claim, and it has also as generally happened that at last the hero has been
obliged, notwithstanding his accumulated honours, to acknowledge the
triumph of a more youthful rival. Pearce has at this time conquered three
most formidable practisers of the gymnasium, Berks, Spray, and Carte, and,
after a general challenge, no one coming to take up the gauntlet, he quietly
set himself to rest, to enjoy the enviable honour which no one dared dispute
his title to. There was, however, yet to be produced, in order to keep up
the spirit of pugilism, some one who possessed courage enough to enter the
ring against this invincible hero. This was considered not easy to be accomplished;
there happens, however, to be a man of the name of Gully, a native
of Bristol, and fellow townsman of the Chicken’s, who for some time has
followed the avocation of a butcher, but being unsuccessful, had taken
country lodgings in the neighbourhood of St. George’s Fields,<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c009'><sup>[94]</sup></a> in a fine open
situation, where he found room enough to exert his muscles in the active
amusement of rackets. Here Pearce, through generosity and goodwill,
which were ever two prominent features of his mind, visited his townsman
and acquaintance, to afford condolence. As every don fellow now does not
consider his equipage complete, unless graced with the Broughtonian mufflers,
Gully had a set, and to fill up the chasm in the afternoon’s amusement the host
and guest must have a set-to. Good humour, as it always should, prevailed, but
Gully did not fail to give the Chicken a few severe hits; in short Gully became
fired with his success, and immediately took it into his head that it was, perhaps,
not impossible to beat the champion. Mr. Fletcher Reid, always actively
alive, like a true sportsman, soon got scent; ‘Gully,’ said he, ‘shall fight
the Chicken:’ his debts were accordingly discharged, and he was taken to
Virginia Water, about two miles beyond Egham, on the western road, to
be put in training. Gully at this time was little known in London, having
never signalized himself as a pugilist. In make he was much such a man
as Jem Belcher, but taller, and longer in the reach. In point of muscular
appearance, a knowing one would not set him down as altogether built for
fighting; however, from the commencement he never funked, being always
sanguine in his hopes of victory. Pearce found some of his old friends, who
backed him 600 guineas to 400, and the day was fixed to be Saturday, July 20,
on which day, in order to keep up the sport, two other matches were to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>decided, between Tom Belcher and Dutch Sam, and between Ryan and Caleb
Baldwin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Virginia Water was appointed as rendezvous, where Gully, Tom
Belcher, and Ryan, had been two months in training, under the auspices
of Mr. Fletcher Reid; and it being understood that the first and main battle
would be fought by eight o’clock in the morning, the whole Fancy were in
commotion and arrived there betimes. Hence they all proceeded to Chobham,
three miles further, where a ring was formed, and all was anxious expectation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whenever John Bull does not see all straight before him, notwithstanding
his being a very drowsy hand at it, he begins to theorise, and this
was the case now. Some said it was ‘all my eye,’ and others more
certainly, ‘there’ll be no fight;’ while others deep in the secret said
it would be a cross. For Mr. Chersey, a knowing one who had formerly
backed Pearce very heavily, had turned round and backed Gully, ‘and by
this no one could tell the enormous money he could win.’ So the sages and
chiefs went to council, and first they decided that ‘<em>all bets</em> should be void.’
But during this awful crisis news arrived that the Surrey magistrates (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dii
minores</span></i>) had interfered, that officers with warrants were abroad, and that <em>that</em>
county was no land for them. Blackwater, beyond Bagshot, was named, and
off started the whole cavalcade. Dutch Sam was mounted in a stylish
buggy, but by some accident the reins broke, the driver jumped out, and left
the Jew with a fast clutch of one rein. Away went the horse, Mishter
Shamuels vociferating to all the heroes of the Pentateuch to save him. He
was, however, soon unshipped, and so severely bruised as to be unable to
fight, and so his match was lost. Blackwater was reached, but the day was
advanced, and disputes went on. Mr. Fletcher Reid declared that if bets did
not stand there should be no fight. Mr. Mellish and the Hon. Berkeley
Craven, offered to back the Chicken to any amount, say 600 guineas to 500.
The amateurs having covered thirty-two miles from London, raised a purse,
and for this Tom Cribb (afterwards the renowned champion of England),
entered the lists with George Nicholls, of Bristol, and was thrashed, for the
first and last time.” See <span class='sc'>Nicholls</span>, in Appendix to Period IV.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tuesday, October 8th, 1805, was next named as “the great important day
big with the fate” of Gully and of Pearce, and Hailsham, a small village in
Sussex, between Brighton and Lewes, was pitched upon for the Campus
Martius. The number of spectators was immense; the Downs being covered
with equestrians and pedestrians, and the “swells” of royal and aristocratic
Brighton being in unusual force. The Duke of Clarence, afterwards
William IV., often referred to witnessing this fight.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>At ten o’clock the combatants met at the place appointed, and, after a
short conference, a 24‒feet rope ring was formed on a green adjoining the
village. At one o’clock the contending champions entered; Gully was
seconded by Tom Jones and Dick Whale; Pearce had Clarke and Joe Ward
for his attendants.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The anxiety round the ring was
intense. Gully made a desperate hit at his
opponent, but fell short, and Pearce immediately
knocked him down. (“Three to
one on the Chicken!” cried a leading
amateur.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Gully put in first blow again. The
Chicken returned sharply, and Gully fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Pearce threw in a blow at his opponent’s
head, which fell short. Gully hit
out and dropped.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Pearce stood up with a smile of confidence
on his brow. Both combatants struck
at once, and both hits were well stopped, but
Gully fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Pearce put in a heavy blow in the neck,
and brought down his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Pearce put in two good hits right and
left, and brought Gully down once more.
(Odds now rose to ten to two on the Chicken).</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Immediately on setting-to Pearce
knocked down his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Much sparring, Pearce put in a hit;
Gully parried in style, and returned with
a knock down blow; Pearce fell for the first
time. Cheers for Gully, and cries, “They
are both Bristol men.”</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Pearce appeared touched: he went in
and knocked Gully down, then turning to
his backers smiled in triumph.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Gully struck out with spirit; Pearce
stopped, and with a thump on the breast
brought down Gully.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Gully put in a neat hit, but the
round terminated by the Chicken’s knocking
him completely off his legs.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Gully threw in a most severe blow,
struck Pearce on the mouth, and brought
him down. Cheers for Gully.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—In this round Gully displayed both
good science and courage; he put in two good
blows, but fell from the force of the last.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Gully came up in good spirits, but
the first blow of the Chicken’s knocked him
off his legs.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Both combatants struck, and both
hits went home. Gully struck again and
fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Gully appeared rather shy, and fell
without a blow being struck.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c009'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>17.—The best round during the battle, if
not that ever was contested. Pearce seemed
confident of beating his man, and stood up
well. Gully rallied, and put in several
good blows, which were returned by the
Chicken without any stopping. Gully
brought down his opponent, after having
successfully planted two good hits on his left
eye. This round was undoubtedly greatly in
Gully’s favour, and the odds fell, bets being
now six to four on the Chicken.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—No fighting. Pearce bled profusely,
and Gully slipped while making play.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Another excellent round. Gully
rallied; Pearce returned; and after some
good blows they closed, and both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Pearce seemed almost blind with his
left eye, and as the blood issued freely, he
fought very shy, and retreated. Gully followed
him up round the ring, and by a good
hit brought Pearce down.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Pearce was very careful, and Gully
in hitting fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Some good blows exchanged. Gully
fell; while falling, Pearce struck him a tremendous
blow on the side of the head, and
Gully vomited.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Pearce struck, but fell short. Gully
put in a good blow over his opponent’s right
eye, and endeavoured to fall, but only being
on his knees, Pearce struck him. Some
cries of “Foul,” but the fight went on.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Pearce very cautious. Gully stuck
to him and followed him round the ring.
Some good blows were exchanged, and
Gully fell again.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—Pearce was now every round gaining
advantage.</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—Gully put in a good hit, and fell.
This irritated Pearce, and he stood over him
apparently much exasperated.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—Long sparring. Pearce struck, but
fell short; Gully struck over his guard, and
it was thought almost blinded his right eye.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—Pearce very shy. Gully followed
him round the ring, but Pearce knocked
him down with a blow in his throat.</p>

<p class='c022'>36.—Gully appeared very weak. He
made a hit at the Chicken’s head, which he
caught, and Pearce made a slight return.
Gully made a good hit, which Pearce parried
with his left hand, and with his right
knocked down his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>37 to 43.—In all these rounds the Chicken
had the advantage; both were bleeding
freely, particularly Gully, whose ear flowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>copiously. Gully appeared shy of advancing;
his head was dreadfully swollen, and his
eyes appeared nearly closed.</p>

<p class='c022'>44.—Pearce dexterously put in his favourite
hit in the throat, and his antagonist fell.
Gully had now received so many severe
blows, that he could not face his man; he,
however, continued to protract the fight by
making a feint hit, and falling, until the</p>

<p class='c022'>64th round, when, by great persuasion, he
yielded the palm, after a contest of one hour
and seventeen minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Both combatants were dreadfully
beaten, neither being hardly able to see
out of either eye. A subscription was immediately
made for the unfortunate champion.
Soon after Gully had given in, Pearce came
up to him, shook hands with him, and said,
“You’re a d——d good fellow; I’m hard
put to it to stand. You are the only man
that ever stood up to me.”</p>

<p class='c022'>This was, as Pearce afterwards said in
private conversation, the severest battle he
ever fought, and that he was never so near
being deprived of his hard-earned position.
As to Gully’s being “a novice,” as he was
termed, Pearce laughed at the notion. He
had all the tactics of a good general, backed
by weight, strength, youth, and resolution.
“He has ‘a head’ for fighting,” said the
Chicken, in his own rough but figurative
language; “he must be a sharp chap, and
get up early, as beats John Gully, I can tell
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>To compliment Pearce on this battle would be unnecessary. His success,
however, had an unexpected and unfortunate influence on the fortunes and
fame of his patron and townsman Jem Belcher, who rashly challenged
Pearce to fight for 500 guineas, play or pay, within two months. The
Chicken, who claimed the championship, had no alternative but to resign
the honour, or take up the gage thus ill-advisedly thrown down.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opinions of the amateurs were, however, much divided. Many, true
to their predilection, stuck to Jem’s irresistibility, and Mr. Fletcher Reid
readily came forward to back Belcher. Captain Halliday covered the 500
on the part of Pearce. To avoid disappointment it was agreed that the
battle should come off not less than 150 miles from the metropolis, to be
decided by a toss between the parties. This Belcher won, and named a
small common three miles from Barnby Moor, and nine miles from Doncaster.
The ground was a short half mile from the seat of Captain Mellish, at Blythe,
and 150 miles from London.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On Friday, December 6th, 1805, Pearce, who had been staying at the
Blue Bell Inn, Bamby Moor, started about eleven o’clock for Blythe, accompanied
by his father. There they met Captain Mellish, Lord Say and Sele,
Lord Eardley, Captain Halliday, the Hon. Berkeley Craven, and other
gentlemen, who accompanied Pearce across the park to the appointed spot,
where Belcher already awaited them. A ring of twenty feet diameter was
formed within another of forty feet, to prevent interruption from the ‘outsiders.’
The partisans on this occasion sported ‘colours.’ Those favouring
Pearce sported a blue silk handkerchief with a white spot, since called
‘bird’s-eye’ and ‘Chicken;’ whilst those adhering to Belcher, sported, with
much pride, the yellow striped flag, known before by the name of the
‘Belcher,’ in honour of the hero. The combatants entered the ring, Will
Ward seconded Pearce, and Bill Gibbons acted as bottle-holder; Joe Ward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>and Dick Whale performing the same offices for Belcher. On stripping
Pearce appeared the stronger man and in best condition, but Belcher was not
in the least daunted, and seemed confident of success. They performed the
well-known salutation, and at half past twelve they set-to. Betting five to
four on the Chicken.”</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The attitudes of both men
were masterly; and the cleverness in sparring
for an opening excited general admiration.
There was much cautious but active
manœuvring. Each seemed aware that to
throw away a chance might lose the battle.
Belcher made several feints, and at length
put in a severe blow on the Chicken’s eye,
over his guard, that drew blood copiously.
The Chicken returned the blow slightly, they
closed, and the Chicken threw his man.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Belcher remarkably active. He again
made several feints, and the Chicken, whose
face was covered with blood, stopped cautiously,
then made a hit. Belcher put in
two blows on the Chicken’s body, and they
closed. The men disengaged themselves.
The Chicken aimed a well-directed hit,
which Belcher stopped dexterously; a rally,
when the Chicken hit one, two, and threw
his man. (Six to four on the Chicken.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—A hard round, rather in favour of the
Chicken. Several blows were exchanged in
a rally made by him. A close, and Belcher
was thrown upon the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Chicken hit twice at his man, but was
out of distance. Belcher rallied with some
success, but was thrown at the end of the
round.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The Chicken continued to bleed freely
from the blow he received in the first round.
He smiled with confidence, however, went
in, and rallied. The struggle closed, in
favour of Belcher, who threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Belcher displayed a good deal of his
accustomed science, and appeared to meet
his man cautiously. In a rally several blows
were exchanged; they closed and fell, Belcher
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—This round was much in favour of
Belcher. The Chicken made a hit, which
Belcher stopped dexterously, and with his
right hand hit the Chicken a severe blow in
the face. A rally followed, in which Belcher
had the advantage; they closed. The
Chicken got his opponent’s head under his
left arm, and hit him several blows with his
right hand: both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Belcher went in, rallied courageously,
and displayed his skill in pugilism to perfection.
He struck several blows with his right
hand, whilst he parried those of the Chicken
with his left. He had considerable advantage
during the round, and ultimately succeeded
in throwing his man over the rope
out of the ring. (The betting became level.)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Both on their mettle, and apparently
fresh. Belcher hit the Chicken a sharp
blow in the face, which cut him severely;
several other blows were exchanged before
the men closed and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Somewhat in favour of the Chicken,
without any blows of consequence. Belcher
appeared to be fast growing weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—The Chicken overreached himself in
making a hit, and the combatants closed.
Belcher disengaged himself by a twist, and
hit his man, who, nevertheless, threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—The Chicken went in and rallied
furiously, and it was evident Belcher had
fallen off in strength. He had materially
the worst of the rally. The Chicken closed,
and threw him on the rope, and had a fair
opportunity of ending the fight, for Belcher
balanced upon his back, and had the Chicken
given him one of his heavy blows, might
have ended the battle at once. But just as
he raised his hand, the spirit of a fair fighter
rose within him: his foe was defenceless.
He put himself in the attitude for delivering
a blow, to show his advantage, then looking
round the ring, he exclaimed, “No, Jem, I
won’t take advantage of thee! no, lest I
hurt thy other eye!” and raising his hands,
went back to his second. “This honourable
step,” says the reporter drily, “was applauded
with shouts from the spectators.”</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Belcher came up slowly. The Chicken
went in for a rally. To the surprise of many,
the men got locked, when Belcher cleverly
got hold of Pearce and sent him over, a
severe cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Tedious sparring. Belcher shy, and
bleeding in the head and body with blows
given in the former round. The Chicken
followed him to the ropes, when he gave
him a hard blow under the blind eye,
through his guard, and threw him easy.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—This round left no hopes for Belcher;
it also decided many bets respecting the first
knock-down blow. The Chicken went in
very gay, and gave his opponent two hits;
they closed, and the Chicken hit Belcher a
blow underneath, on the lower rib, which,
to use the sporting phrase, doubled him
together, and he fell. The umpire, for the
satisfaction of the sporting men, declared
this to be a knock-down blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Belcher hit the Chicken a well-directed
but feeble blow in the face, whilst
sparring. The Chicken smiled, shook his
head, and then went into a rally. Once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>more he got him on the ropes, as in the
twelfth round, when he repeated his honourable
conduct, and walked away without
hitting him. This round decided the fight,
notwithstanding Belcher fought one more.
In the rally he was first thrown upon one of
the stakes to which the ropes were fastened,
and it was supposed he had broken the lower
rib, the Chicken having hit him in the same
place shortly before. (Ten to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Belcher summoned up all his efforts
to put in a blow, but the Chicken again followed
him to the ropes, and threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Belcher could not move his left arm
from his side; he, however, stood up to fight
the eighteenth round, but finding himself
totally disabled, he resigned the contest,
after fighting thirty-five minutes. The
Chicken immediately leaped over the rope
out of the ring, and entered it again in the
same manner, displaying his agility by a
somersault.</p>

<p class='c022'>“On this day the wreath of victory, which
had so long encircled the brow of Belcher,
was torn off by the powerful grasp of the
very man for whose success Belcher had
evinced so much anxiety. Envy appeared
the principal excitement in the mind of
Jem to the contest, and to that passion he
undoubtedly sacrificed his honours, and fell
a pitiable victim. Under a mistaken impulse,
after having successfully triumphed
over such formidable opponents as Paddington
Jones, Bartholomew, Gamble, Berks,
and Firby, his well gained fame expired.
It was evident, independent of the great
disadvantage which Belcher unhappily sustained
in the loss of an eye, that neither his
strength nor constitution at this time could
enable him to encounter with any chance of
success, an opponent possessing such an
astonishing degree of skill, agility, wind,
muscular power, and, in short, every requisite
that the most theoretic mind could suggest
for a pugilist. Belcher, in the course
of the combat, put in several of his favourite
blows, and got off in his accustomed happy
manner; but the longer the fight lasted, so
much the greater became his disadvantage,
and every one conversant in boxing allowed,
that had he planted more hits, instead of
employing his time in unavailing and useless
sparring, he would have stood a better chance
of gaining a victory. Pearce, throughout
the combat, without a doubt, aimed the
generality of his blows at Belcher’s good
eye, well aware of the result of closing it,
and in closing, Pearce gave him some tremendous
falls.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Upon the whole, if the combat was not
so obstinately contested as might have been
anticipated, there was in it a display of
science perhaps unprecedented. Those, however,
who had witnessed Belcher in any of
his former battles, could perceive a deficiency
in his fighting in many points, notwithstanding
he displayed all his former courage.
After they had fought a quarter of an hour,
Belcher displayed marks of some violent
hits in his face, and his firm bright eye
rolled in the briny flood. The loss of his
eyes was a greater disadvantage to him than
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</span></i> was supposed; it rendered him
unable to judge the length of his opponent,
nor could he perceive the hits coming towards
him until it was too late to guard
against them. With respect to his own
blows, as he himself observed, after the
fight, they were merely casual attempts, for
his sight was not sufficiently quick and
strong to plant them judiciously. Every
one who had on former occasions admired
with enthusiasm the unexampled courage
and skill of Belcher, felt deeply for his unfortunate
situation, and in many an eye was
seen the sympathetic tear to start. His
spirits were good to the last; and after its
conclusion he exclaimed, not without seeming
to feel the assertion, ‘I don’t mind for
myself, but I’m sorry for a friend of mine,
who has lost everything he had.’ A subscription
was set on foot by Jackson, and
very liberally supplied. Belcher was taken
to a surgeon’s and bled, where, upon examination,
they found the rib expected to have
been broken was perfect.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Game Chicken retired to the Blue Bell Inn, at Barnby Moor, and
seriously declared that once or twice he had it in his power to have killed
Belcher. Elated with his victory, he cried out in the Somersetshire dialect,
“Dang it, I’m not hurt, I have only cut my crook against his teeth;” and
pulling out of his pocket a new blue silk handkerchief, spotted with white,
tied it round his neck, and laughing, said, “Since I’ve won it I’ll wear it;
no more Belchers now.” After taking some refreshment, they set off for
Grantham, where Captain Halliday had ordered dinner for a large party.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Chicken had now entirely proved himself thorough game; and was
without a competitor for a while. A man of the name of Ford, a stalwart
gamekeeper from Leicestershire, came up to London about this time, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>challenged Pearce for fifty guineas. The Chicken offered to accommodate
him for 200 guineas, as a minimum stake for the champion. Ford came
to town in April, 1807, while Pearce was at Bristol, and vapoured greatly
of his willingness to fight the absent champion for a glass of Liptrap.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c009'><sup>[96]</sup></a> It
was probably fortunate the Chicken was not there, or Mr. Ford might have
found himself out of his depth. We hear no more of “Master Ford,” who
showed better wisdom in minding “buck-washing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pearce, like too many of his predecessors of pugilistic notoriety, foundered
on the same rock on which they had split. Examples, advice, and lessons, it
should seem, all lose their effect upon persons, who, in the bloom of youth,
health and vigour, laugh at the idea of incurring any serious consequences
from intemperance, till they find it out for themselves, when, generally it is
too late to be remedied. The Chicken during his residence in the metropolis
had made rather too free with his constitution; yet we have authority for
observing that it originated more from circumstances and place, than sheer
inclination. His health became impaired, and he retired to his native city,
to enjoy the comforts of domesticated life; and by the advice of his friends,
he relinquished the calling of a pugilist for that of a publican.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have now arrived at an episode in the life of Pearce, which we would
earnestly recommend to the perusal of the calumniators of pugilists and
pugilism; we doubt if a similar deed can be recorded of many of the canters
who decry prize-fighters as “inhuman savages!”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the month of November, 1807, a fire broke out at Mrs. Denzill’s, a silk-mercer,
in Thomas Street, Bristol, and the flames had made such rapid
progress, that the servant in the house, a poor girl, who had retired to rest
in the attic story, was nearly enveloped in flames before she awoke to her
dreadful situation. Frantic with despair, she presented herself at the window
imploring help—her screams pierced the hearts of the spectators, who
appeared riveted with terror to the spot, expecting every moment her
threatened destruction. But none move; all are petrified with fear and
horror. At length, Pearce (“the prize-fighter by profession and the savage
by nature,” according to “Craven,”) appears in the crowd; he sees the life
of a human being in danger, and feels prompted to the perilous endeavour
of an immediate rescue. By the aid of the adjoining house, he reaches the
parapet, and, hanging over it, firmly grasps the wrist of the wretched girl—the
multitude are lost in astonishment, and never did a more interesting
moment present itself—hope, fear, and all the stronger emotions are on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>rack at the intrepidity of a man losing every thought of self in the hope
of delivering a fellow-creature from a dreadful death. The additional weight,
added to the height from the parapet, was almost too much for the nearly
exhausted energies of Pearce.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Cowards die many times before their deaths,</div>
      <div class='line'>The valiant never taste of death but once;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>and so it proved—Pearce’s brave heart leaped within him, and with a supreme
effort he drew his trembling charge from the window, placed her safe upon
the parapet, and in an instant she was out of danger. The delighted multitude
was loud in their plaudits—and the almost lifeless sufferer clinging round
the knees of her deliverer, invoked blessings on his name. This was the
proudest moment of Pearce’s life. The shouts of victory, and the flattering
praises that had so often attended him in the hour of battle, were mere
shadows compared with that of an approving conscience. Yet this was the
act of a pugilist!—one who had entered the field to obtain a purse of gold as
a prize-fighter. Here was no gold to tempt him to risk his life: the smallest
deviation of balance must have precipitated him headlong to destruction;
and no opportunity of retreating from the consequences. The gallant soldier
in mounting the forlorn hope, and the hardy tar in boarding the ship of the
enemy, are stimulated by a thirst of glory and love of country, but Pearce
was actuated by no other motive than that of humanity; and when that
“recording angel,” who dropped a tear and blotted out for ever the intemperate
expression of my Uncle Toby, shall turn the page of the evil deeds
of this pugilist, let us trust they may be similarly obliterated.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <cite>Arliss’s Magazine</cite>, and the “Poets’ Corner” of <cite>Farley’s Bristol Journal</cite>,
we find the subjoined lines, more remarkable for their good feeling than
poetic merit:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In Bristol city, while a house in flames</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Fills the beholders with amazement dire,</div>
      <div class='line'>A damsel at an upper window claims</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Their utmost pity, for th’ approaching fire—</div>
      <div class='line'>Which every moment seems to gather near,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor hope of rescue does there aught appear.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“At length upon the neighb’ring house-top seen,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A gallant youth now hastens to her aid,</div>
      <div class='line'>And o’er the fearful parapet does lean,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With spirit dauntless, to assist the maid;</div>
      <div class='line'>Endowed by heaven with more than common might,</div>
      <div class='line'>He grasps her arms, and draws her to the height.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, glorious act! Oh, courage well applied!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oh, strength exerted in its proper cause!</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Live, ever honour’d, midst the world’s applause;</div>
      <div class='line'>Be this thy triumph! know one creature saved,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is greater glory than a world enslav’d.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>A short time after the noble deed we have narrated the Game Chicken
again distinguished himself in rescuing one of the fair sex from insult and
danger. In his way over Clifton Downs, near Bristol, Pearce perceived a
young woman suffering much from the rude attacks of three men. Regardless
of the consequences Pearce instantly interposed, when they fell upon him
with fury; but the courage and science of Pearce soon made them repent
of their temerity. The Chicken received their onset with such coolness and
intrepidity, and so successfully planted his levelling hits, that one of them
of the name of Hood, was so satisfied, in seven minutes, that he bolted, and
left his companions to the care of Pearce. In a quarter of an hour, the
Chicken so served out Morris and Francis, the other two, that they declined
the strife, and apologised for their rudeness, while the terrified female could
only thank her gallant defender for his seasonable protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would seem that, however Pearce might have been crowned with
honour, gratified by the enviable title of champion, and admired by his
friends in general—he was not happy. That source of true felicity and real
consolation, to which a man flies to alleviate his troubles or participate in his
honours, was unhappily polluted, and his wife’s incontinence had rendered
home so miserable, that he left his native place never more to return.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pearce now went to different country towns exhibiting sparring, and
teaching the art of self-defence, and we need hardly say was much patronised.
The Chicken was in the neighbourhood of Oxford when Jem Belcher and
Cribb fought their last battle, and felt so anxious as to the issue of the
combat, that he set off in a post-chaise overnight lest he should fail to
witness the fight. On Cribb’s proving victorious, he exclaimed with great
earnestness, “he hoped he should get well, that he might teach Cribb how to
fight!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pearce took a benefit at the Fives Court, on February 9, 1809, when some
good sparring was exhibited. Every interest was exerted to give him
support. Pearce was now the victim of pulmonary consumption, and in the
last stage of that afflicting disease; he was scarcely able to walk to the Court
to thank his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appearance of the Chicken was muscular; his height about five feet
nine inches; and the roundness of his chest and limbs denoted considerable
strength, in some degree resembling the contour of the champion, Tom
Johnson. During the time Pearce enjoyed sound health, his excellence as a
pugilist was admitted by all parties; and he stood above all competitors. In
uniting the courage of a lion with true kindness of heart, Pearce must command
our praise. He was a tremendous hard hitter, and his left-handed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>blow was so terrible in its effects, that his opponents have been seen in a
complete state of stupor for several seconds, and often never recovered the
proper use of their faculties during the fight.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a proof that he was not fond of vainly courting the popularity of the
multitude, or of making a show of himself by figuring upon the box of some
spoilt child of fortune’s four-in-hand—a fashion in full power in those days;
we may state, that immediately upon putting on his clothes, after his
memorable fight with Berks, on Wimbledon Common, he stole away unobserved.
Being missed, a general inquiry took place among his friends, to
know what had become of him. After considerable time lost in search of the
Chicken, some person recollected that they saw a man like Pearce run and
jump up behind a coach; upon which information his second, Bill Gibbons,
endeavoured to trace him along the road, and at length found the Chicken in
a public-house at Chelsea, cooking himself mutton-chops at the fire, with the
most perfect indifference. Pearce immediately invited Gibbons to partake
of them without alluding to his singularity in leaving the ground, instead of
making his return to town in triumph on some swell-drag, in the style
of the days of which we are writing.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the Coach and Horses, St. Martin’s Lane,<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c009'><sup>[97]</sup></a> on Sunday, April 30, 1809,
the Game Chicken departed this life. His fortitude never forsook him, and
in the most trying moments he displayed calmness and resignation; he
experienced no terrors from his approaching end, expressing a wish to die in
friendship with all mankind. He expressed a strong desire to be buried by
the side of Bill Warr, in St. James’ burying ground, Pancras; and this wish
was complied with. Pearce was in his thirty-second year.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>JOHN GULLY—1805‒1808.</h4>

<p class='c013'>When Hen. Pearce, compelled by severe bodily illness to retire from the
fistic arena, seceded from the position of champion, John Gully was looked
to by common consent as his successor. He was one of those who achieve
a high fame by defeat, and we have Pearce’s own recorded opinion that he
was the best man he had ever fought with. Gully’s ambition was of a high
order; like Jackson, second and third-rate pugilists were beneath his aim,
and spurning the better and safer mode of acquiring greatness step by step,
his daring spirit made the essay of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Vaulting ambition which o’erleaps itself,</div>
      <div class='line'>And falls o’ the other side.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Yet here he showed an exception to the approved rule, for, by at once
attacking the justly renowned Game Chicken, though he fell, he rose
indisputably a greater man, from the excellent qualities he displayed on
this bold but unsuccessful attempt. Gully convinced the sporting world that
he was able to contend with honour, and even with a considerable chance
of success, with the supposed invincibility of that eminent pugilist, whose
generosity of disposition would not permit him to quit his vanquished
adversary without complimenting him upon his uncommon bravery and
fortitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>In these two years (1805, 1806), Gully does not seem to have publicly
desired the title of champion, which was rather conceded to him. In
September, 1807, by an incidental passage in the daily papers, it would
seem he was so considered. On the 5th of that month (September), Horton
beat George Cribb (brother of Tom the after champion) and offered to fight
either Gully “for the championship,” or Tom Cribb for fifty guineas, but
both declined.</p>

favourite with the Fancy in general. His knowledge of the art of boxing
was considered complete, and his courage an able second to his judgment.
His supporters were numerous, and his fame stood so high, that upwards
of two years elapsed, from the time of his battle with the Chicken, October
8, 1805, before any one had the temerity to call on him to defend his title
to the championship. At length he entered the lists with the formidable and
burly Bob Gregson, a boxer, who had been picked out by some of his friends
in Lancashire, as likely to lower the crest of the champion. Gregson’s size
was considerably in his favour, he being nearly six feet two inches high,
of prodigious strength, and had signalised himself in several pugilistic
contests in that part of the country; but, notwithstanding such striking
advantages, his pretensions were considered on the score of strength rather
than of science. Gregson’s game was unquestionable, and the amateurs
wishing to see him enter the lists with so distinguished a boxer as Gully,
a subscription was immediately entered into for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 14th October, 1807, the contest took place in a valley, called Six
Mile Bottom, on the Newmarket Road, on the spot where, in later days, the
writer witnessed the defeat of Jemmy Massey, of Manchester, and Edwards,
of Cheltenham. For miles round this part of the country the bustle commenced
at an early hour, groups of people thronging from every direction, to
witness the battle. Between nine and ten Gully and Gregson entered the
ring, both in excellent spirits and good condition. The former was seconded
by Cribb, Cropley acting as bottle holder. Richmond was Gregson’s mentor,
and Harry Lee was his bottle holder. Bill Warr and John Jackson were
also in the ring; “lest,” says the report, “occasion might demand their
services.” On setting-to the odds were six to four in favour of Gully.</p>

<p class='c007'>The combatants shook hands and bowed to the spectators, as if at a sparring
benefit; and at a few minutes after ten o’clock, threw themselves into
position for</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c009'><sup>[98]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The combatants fixed each
other with a steady eye; a pause; some
excellent sparring. Gully put in a well-aimed
blow in his opponent’s face. Gregson
returned on the side of the head. They
closed and both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Gully now appeared conscious of his
opponent’s strength, was very careful, and
showed some excellent science; he put in
another severe hit in Gregson’s face, blood
ran profusely, and Gregson fell. (Odds rose
100 to 20 on Gully.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—In every round some excellent hits
were exchanged, and no advantage could be
claimed.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—After some neat sparring, Gregson
broke through his adversary’s guard, and
put in a straight forward blow on his right
eye. This drew blood; the eye swelled and
nearly closed; Gully fell and lay quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>stunned for three seconds. Among Gully’s
friends the greatest anxiety remained for
some moments, and the odds fell five to one.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Gregson stood up, seemingly inspired
with his success in the last round, summoned
all his strength, and exerted all his science.
Gully rallied; some good sparring, and afterwards
both put in some excellent blows, and
great skill was displayed in stopping; at last
Gregson, by a sudden effort of power, caught
up Gully in his arms, and flung him with
astonishing force upon the ground; every
one expected he would have fallen on him,
but this, with the greatest generosity, he
declined, for which he was cheered by every
spectator. By the amateurs present this was
thought to be the finest round that was ever
fought, and now all felt convinced that it
was only Gully’s superior science that could
enable him to stand against so formidable
an opponent. (Odds changed in favour of
Gregson.)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Gully put in another hit in the face,
and Gregson very deliberately laid himself
down on his hands and knees. This was
thought to be something of the cur, but his
conduct afterwards did away with such unfavourable
impressions.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Gully struck; Gregson closed, and
threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Gully in this round evinced great
weakness, and the odds continued in Gregson’s
favour; after some feeble hits from
Gully, Gregson knocked him down by a most
tremendous blow on the forehead.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Gully’s science gave him a superiority
again in this round. But he was very
weak, and his deliveries devoid of force.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Gregson struck Gully in the face,
right and left; they rallied severely, and
Gregson fell on his knees, apparently very
weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—After exchanging a few hits, Gregson
knocked Gully down.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Gully carried the most marks in the
face, and his eye was quite closed; they
rallied, and Gully struck his adversary off
his legs.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—At the end of the last round Gully
had a severe fall, but the advantage throughout
the whole.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Gregson endeavoured to repeat his
successful straight-forward blow, but missed,
and while falling Gully struck him. “Foul!”
and “Fair!” were vociferated, but the latter
was correct, as Gregson was not down.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Gully began to appear more gay, and
both combatants rallied desperately; both
appeared very weak, but Gully’s bottom was
known, and odds were now eight to one in
his favour.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Here it was anybody’s battle; the
combatants both appeared beaten and exhausted.
They were dreadfully disfigured,
and neither hardly capable of getting off his
second’s knee.</p>

<p class='c022'>Notwithstanding each from the great loss
of blood had the utmost difficulty in making
fight, the battle lasted eleven more rounds,
each alternately having the advantage, and
betting became even. At length they met
like two inebriated men, helpless, and almost
incapable of holding up their hands either
to stop or hit, and every round finished by
both rolling down together. Still Gully was
the favourite, and by an astonishing effort of
nature, in the thirty-sixth round he put in a
blow, which, although feeble, was sufficiently
strong to prevent Gregson’s rising again in
time. Gregson laid for some minutes, incapable
of either moving or speaking, but
Gully, even now, elated with victory, leaped
with joy.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It would be difficult to say
which was the most beaten, such spectacles
were never before witnessed. The battle
was allowed to excel everything, in point of
game and slashing exchanges, that ever had
been displayed. Even those who had seen
Johnson, Big Ben, Jackson, and Symonds
contend, allowed this to exceed all. Captain
Barclay took Gully off the ground in his
carriage, and the next day both combatants
appeared on the race-course, but Gregson
could not remain long, and on returning
home was forced to call in medical aid.
Gully in this contest showed he had become
much more expert than when he contended
with the Game Chicken. He, however, certainly
fought at great disadvantage against
a man of such superior strength and length
as Gregson. He could never make a hit
until his opponent chose to begin, as Gregson
sparred with his left arm fully extended,
which was much longer and stronger than
Gully’s. Gregson’s favourite hit is a desperate
lunge with his right hand, which
nothing can resist, and by that means Gully
became so much beaten. Gregson was
mostly abroad, and Gully generally returned
with great adroitness and advantage. His
left arm was severely hurt in the commencement
of the battle, in endeavouring to parry
the right-handed hits of his adversary.</p>

<p class='c013'>November, 1807. Notwithstanding Gregson was so severely beaten by
Gully in the last month, he still felt some confidence, that in the event of
another battle he should prove victorious. His friends gave him all
encouragement, and he sent Gully the following challenge, which was
forwarded to Norwich, where he was then staying:—</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“Mr. <span class='sc'>Gully</span>,—It is the wish of myself and friends that I should try my fortune with
you in another battle, for £200 a-side. If you are inclined to give me the opportunity, I
will thank you to say so, and also to name the time when it will be convenient to meet, to

<p class='c007'>Wednesday, May 10th, 1808, was soon known to be the day fixed for the
“big fight for the championship.” On the previous Saturday it was understood
in the privileged circle that those who repaired to the confines of the
counties of Bedford and Bucks., about a couple of miles from Woburn, would
be handy to the spot. This “tip” it would seem reached others than those
for whom it was intended for. The Marquis of Buckingham publicly gave
notice of his determination to frustrate the sport, by publishing the following
notice in the <cite>County Chronicle</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>What follows may give a lively picture of an expedition to “see a fight”
in the days of the “Third George.” We extract from the <cite>Morning
Chronicle</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some hundreds, whose leisure and disposition prompted them to be in
action, started on the Saturday and Sunday, and secured beds and stabling
in all the villages and hamlets contiguous to Woburn. The town of Woburn
was on Monday in continual motion, all was uproar and confusion, people
of all ranks continually arriving on foot, on horseback, and in carriages
of all description, and all seeking accommodation which only a few comparatively
could find. To add to the confusion, the Marquis of Buckingham
did not fail to exert himself for the fulfilment of his threat; all the magistracy
of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, at the head of their constables and
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse comitatus</span></i><a id='t186'></a>, with a subsidiary force of volunteers from the surrounding
districts, appeared determined to resist this unlicensed incursion into their
territories, and to stand an insurmountable barrier to the amusement. The
Dunstable volunteers were out very early on the Monday morning, with
drums beating, colours flying, cartouch-boxes doubly provided, bayonets
fixed, and all in awful military array. The peasantry were shaking with
fear, supposing the French had landed, and those who had arrived began
to think they were hoaxed, and that they should return without being gratified
by the fight. Many who itched to be betting, began to sport on the question
whether the fight was ‘to be or not to be,’ and ten to one was frequently
betted, that no fight would take place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When Monday night arrived hundreds had flocked into the town, and
all were eagerly enquiring for beds. Nothing could be obtained of this kind,
for the night’s lodging, under 30<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> a head, and to sit or lie on the chairs
of the public rooms the usual price of a bed was extorted. In one room at
Woburn fifteen gentlemen laid on the floor, and were happy to pay for this
hard fare, and hundreds reposed in their carriages. The horses, notwithstanding
the weather was severe, were obliged to stand without covering.
Tuesday came, and these glorious comforts were yet to be endured; pay the
price asked you must, as the landlord was generally sharp enough to secure
the boots of every traveller, if he had nothing else to lay hold of for security.</p>

<p class='c007'>“About five o’clock on the Wednesday morning all was again in commotion,
and notwithstanding the endeavours of the magistrates, a ring
was formed upon Ashley Common, raised with sods about twelve inches
from the ground, and about forty feet in circumference. Between six and
seven o’clock many of the amateurs came dashing direct from London, in
their barouches and four, and in order to direct them to the proper spot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Bill Richmond was placed at the Magpie. The multitude soon got the hint,
and followed the bang-up leaders. By nine o’clock a number of carriages
had arrived, and were safely penned up. The amateurs viewed the ring,
and were expressing their high approbation at its appearance, when a
messenger arrived with fresh information that the magistrates had seen the
ring in the morning, and were still determined to prevent the battle. Many
of the knowing ones suspected that this was a hoax, and immediately sent
off an express to Hogstale, a public-house about a mile distant, where
Gregson held his head quarters. Before the answer, however, returned,
Mendoza, dressed in green, and mounted in style, dashed up with two or
three well-known amateurs, and gave positive assurances that the battle
would not be fought there. Upon this solemn assurance every one started
for Gregson’s lodgings, where they found the hero seated in Lord Barrymore’s
barouche, with the horses’ heads turned towards Woburn, and escorted by
about 150 noblemen and gentlemen on horseback, and an immense retinue
of gigs, tandems, curricles, and every species of vehicle. Hundreds not
apprised of the change in the seat of combat, were advancing from Woburn.
Soon the two streams met, and forming one almost irresistible current,
returned through Woburn with accumulated force, the knowing ones leading
the way, having been before apprised, that in case of any unforeseen disappointment
at the original spot, they were to rendezvous at several places
in reversion; the first of which was Sir John Sebright’s, in Hertfordshire,
about seventeen miles distant from Ashley Common, the whole extent of
which was covered by one solid mass of passengers; and although many
had sorely repented their expedition, and returned homewards, the multitude
appeared not the least diminished. Broken down carriages obstructed the
road; knocked up horses fell and could not be got any farther; a guinea a
mile was offered for conveyance, and many hundreds of gentlemen were
happy in being jolted in brick carts for a shilling a mile. By two o’clock
they arrived at Sir John Sebright’s park; a flat spot immediately opposite
the house, but about half-a-mile distant, was pitched upon for the battle, and
upon the whole the uninvited guests behaved with tolerable decorum. A
ring was formed, the exterior circle was nearly an acre, surrounded by
a triple ring of horsemen, and a double row of pedestrians, who, notwithstanding
the wetness of the ground, laid down with great pleasure, and the
forty feet ring was soon completed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“About three o’clock a torrent of rain poured down, and every one began
to be anxious for the fight; very shortly after Gregson, Gully, Mendoza,
Harry Lee, Joe Ward, Hen. Pearce, Cribb, Horton, Dutch Sam, Cropley,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Gibbons, Richmond, and several other pugilists and amateurs, entered the
ring. It is impossible to describe the pleasure that beamed in the eyes
of every spectator at this moment, and the welkin echoed their repeated
plaudits.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cribb and Horton, who, according to their articles, were to fight in the
same ring as Gully and Gregson, directly stripped and set-to, both in
excellent spirits. Odds four to five on Cribb who very easily gained the
conquest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Immediately on the conclusion of this combat the champions stripped.
Both fought in silk stockings without shoes, and white breeches. Harry
Lee seconded Gregson, and Joe Word, Gully. Captain Barclay was appointed
deciding umpire. After the usual etiquette they set-to.”</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c009'><sup>[99]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The combatants both sparred
about a minute; the utmost silence prevailing
in every part of the ring, and every one
had his eye fixed stedfastly on the contending
champions. Here Gully displayed one
of the most signal specimens of the art of
boxing that perhaps ever was witnessed, by
putting in two most dexterous hits through
his opponent’s guard, at the same moment,
in the mouth and throat. Gregson fell like
a log, and was instantly covered with blood.
The greatest commotion was now excited,
and peal succeeded peal of applause. (The
odds rose six to four on Gully.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Gregson ineffectually aimed a hit at
his opponent’s head, who shifted, and pointed
at him. Gully now commenced a rally, and
some blows were exchanged to his advantage.
Gregson turned round and put in a back-handed
blow in the loins; both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Gregson successfully planted a right-handed
hit in Gully’s breast, and rallied;
but Gully had the advantage of putting in
most blows, although Gregson threw him.
Gregson’s head had now began to swell, and
he continued to bleed freely. (Odds two to
one on Gully.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Gully made play, and after planting
two good hits on his adversary’s head,
slipped up.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Gregson made a determined hit, which
Gully scientifically parried, upon which he
ran in, grasped Gully by the thighs, held
him in his arms, and threw him down.
Great disapprobation.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Some good rallying, but in favour of
Gully. Gregson appeared incapable of stopping,
and Gully hit him as he pleased. At
the close of the round Gregson put in a tremendous
blow on the side of his adversary’s
head, and both fell out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Gully rallied; put in six successive
hits on Gregson’s head, and at length
knocked him off his legs, without the latter
getting home one blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—In this round Gregson slightly had the
advantage. They closed, and Gully received
a heavy fall; Gregson’s left eye was now
almost closed, his nose broken, the blood
flowed copiously, and his head was most
hideously disfigured.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Gregson evinced distress, and Gully
hit him again severely in the face. Gregson
fell on his knees.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—As early as this round the result of
the battle was considered decided. Gregson
fought shy, both eyes being nearly closed.
He struck Gully, who was down, but it
appeared to be with his own choice.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Gregson excited commiseration; he
put his hand to his left eye, and afterwards
looked at it; but instantly commenced a
rally, which ended again in his discomfiture.
Gully knocked him down, but while falling
he put in a back-handed hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Gregson struck Gully on the breast,
who immediately knocked him off his legs
by a flush hit in the mouth.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—In making play Gully slipped.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Gully again hit his opponent through
his guard, both right and left, which brought
him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>15 and 16.—In both rounds Gregson ineffectually
attempted to hold his ground.
He seemed confused; however, he ran in,
and completely bored Gully down.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—In this round Gregson became intemperate,
and ran in upon his adversary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>who continued hitting and avoiding him in
a most surprising manner. Gregson twice
turned his back upon his opponent, and
made towards the ropes, but Gully followed
him, changed his front, fibbed him, and kept
him from falling, until he had hit him into an
almost senseless state, and then dropped
him quietly between his arms.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Like the former, Gregson was again
severely punished.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—In this round Gully put in two tremendous
blows.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—Gregson was brought down by a
heavy blow under the ear; and the</p>

<p class='c022'>28th round decided the contest, Gregson
being too much exhausted to be brought to
the mark in time. The battle lasted one
hour and a quarter.</p>

<p class='c022'>The superiority of Gully in this battle was
evident, and throughout the fight there was
no comparison between the quickness, hitting,
and confidence of the combatants.
Several of the fighting men, and many good
judges of pugilism, had great doubts as to
the event, from the determined manner in
which the former battle had been contested
and several entertained a strong opinion that
Gregson, having added science to his great
strength, from the improvement he had
evinced in sparring, had much increased his
chances of success. Gully possessed so much
confidence in his own abilities, that, a few
minutes before he entered the ring, he
offered to back himself for £50 (in addition
to what he had already betted) that he was
the winner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Without offering further comments of our own on this most remarkable
battle, as we do not find any worthy of preservation, in a pugilistic sense, in
the published reports, we may take it as a significant fact of the excellence
of Gully’s condition, that, <em>before putting on his outer clothes</em>, he advanced to the
ropes and addressed the referee and leading patrons of the ring to the effect,
that being now in business in a tavern in Carey Street, he was in hopes that
he should have enjoyed peace unchallenged. That he had not intended to
fight again, nor would he have done so in this instance, had he not considered
himself bound in honour to accept Gregson’s challenge. That he had fought
with a partially disabled left arm, and that Gregson surely would not urge
him to another combat. “Gully then dressed himself, and was brought
to town in Lord Barrymore’s barouche. The following morning he was
facetiously answering questions respecting the fight, and serving his
numerous customers at the Plough, in Carey Street.”<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c009'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The defeated Gregson was conveyed to the principal inn in Markyate Street,
Herts., where he remained until the following Saturday, by which time he
was well enough to return to Highgate, on the box of one of the Northampton
coaches. Here he remained with a friend at the Bowling Green tavern for
some time. Captain Barclay, the Marquis of Tweeddale, and other gentlemen
and noblemen made a liberal subscription for him; and at his urgent request
he was soon after matched with Tom Cribb, to fight for 500 guineas, in a
thirty foot ring. (See <span class='sc'>Cribb</span>, Period IV.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In the beginning of the following month (June, 1808), Gully and Cribb
took a joint benefit at the Fives Court; Gully and Jem Belcher, Cribb and
Tom Belcher, Tom Jones and Tom Blake, Cropley and Dogherty, George
Cribb and Wood, were among the leading exhibitors. Gully repeated his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>declaration of retirement from the ring, and public opinion looked upon the
coming fight of Tom Cribb and Gregson as a sort of test as to Gully’s
successor.</p>

<p class='c007'>In taking leave of so remarkable a man as the subject of the present
memoir, a man who after many years of intercourse with the most eminent
public men of his time, arrived at fortune, fame, and even senatorial honours,
we may be suspected of panegyric from personal knowledge, and a desire to
dilate on a theme so immediately connected with the history of British
pugilism as the merits of its professors, while it yet had the name and
standing which it has, much through the misconduct of its members, temporarily
lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gully, as a pugilist, has well earned a niche in the temple of pancratic
fame; and if his battles were not so numerous as many other professors
have been, they were contested with a decision of science and game, rarely
equalled, perhaps never excelled, and justly entitle him to honourable
mention in the records of boxing. His practice, it was well known, had
been very confined, and his theoretical knowledge of the science could not
have been very extensive, yet his natural courage and quickness surmounted
these difficulties, and, with a fortitude equal to any man, he entered the ring
a most consummate pugilist. Though his frame was never a model of symmetry,
he had many points of the athletic build. His height was about
six feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>We cannot conclude this sketch of Mr. Gully without remarking that,
with the knowledge of the world, he united the manners of a well-bred
man; intelligent and quick of observation, he united with those qualifications,
when moving in a less elevated sphere, that proper sense of his own capabilities,
which generally attends intelligence and merit. After a few years
passed in the occupation of a tavern-keeper, in which he earned general
respect, he was so fortunate in turf speculations, and so well served by
sound judgment in racing matters, that he retired and became the purchaser
of Ware Park, Hertfordshire. Here he associated with the first circles of the
county; fortune still smiling on him, he became a spirited breeder and racehorse
proprietor, an owner of collieries, and lastly, in 1832, attained the
proud position of one of England’s senators; being returned to parliament as
representative for Pontefract, in the first reformed parliament. We recently
heard a blockhead object that Mr. Gully was originally a butcher: his father,
whom he succeeded, was a master butcher of respectability—so was the father
of Cardinal Wolsey. We have had among succeeding occupants of the woolsack,
a Newcastle barber’s son, and the offspring of a grocer; one prime minister,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>the son of an actress; another the descendant of a cotton spinner; the
greatest engineering genius of our age, the son of a pitman, himself a
furnace-stoker, and, as we shall presently see, a pugilist; so that surely
such sneers at self-made men by those who have certainly not made themselves
are too snobbish and contemptible to affect any but their utterers.
A paragraph from the pen of a sportsman must find a place here:</p>

<p class='c019'>“It was the late Mr. Buckland who, when on a visit to Lord Fitzwilliam, told me of the
impression made upon him by the appearance of a fine handsome gentleman coming up the
staircase with a beautiful girl in green velvet on either arm—the member for Pontefract,
with two of his daughters. Poor “Sylvanus” thus portrayed Mr. Gully in the very zenith of
his career:—‘He had permanent lodgings at Newmarket, well and tastily furnished, and
dispensed his hospitality to his friends with no sparing hand. An excellent cook, claret from
Griffiths’, with an entertaining gentleman-like host, left little to be desired at the dinner
awaiting us. Mr. Gully is justly esteemed, having raised himself from the lowest paths of life
to the position, not merely of wealth, but to that of intimacy amongst gentlemen, on or off the
turf, but still gentlemen in taste, which nought but the undeviating good manners, and entertaining,
unpresuming deportment of Gully could for a moment, or rather for any length of
time beyond a moment, suffer them to tolerate. No man ever possessed these qualifications,
gained through innate acuteness, great common sense, and a plastic disposition to observe
and benefit by the chance <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontres</span></i> with the courtly patrons of his day to a greater degree,
taking the early disadvantages he had to contend with into consideration, than John Gully.
No man could be more above pretence, or less shy at any allusions to his early and not very
polished career, than himself. When I dined with him at Newmarket, as well as upon subsequent
occasions, I was most gratified by his manly openness, and lack of all sensitive false
shame, on any occasional appeal being made to the bygone. He, on the contrary, entered
freely into many entertaining portions of his history, answered all my questions <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</span></i>,
and with perfect good nature, as to the mode of training, hitting so as not to injure the
hand, wrestling, and other minutiæ of the ring; passing the claret and slicing the pine, as if
foaled at Knowsley or Bretby. He had a quiet sly way of joking on any turf affair, on
which, bear in mind, he was as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fait</span></i> as Zamiel making a book for the Derby. The turbot
came from Billingsgate by express, and the haunch from his own park. Moët purveyed the
champagne, Marjoribanks the port, and, as I have before said, Griffiths the Lafitte. We had
no skulking host be assured, but the most entertaining and liberal one alive.’ There is a
genial tone about this sketch that tells at once for its truth, and it would be difficult to give
any man a better character. Gully’s position at every turn and phase of fortune was still a
trying one, but no man more fairly earned the respect he gained. There is a very moral of
good manners in such a man’s history.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Gully died at Durham, on Monday, the 9th of March, 1863, in the
80th year of his age, being born at Bristol, August 21, 1783. He was
buried at Ackworth Hall, near that city, on Saturday, March 14, leaving
a family of five sons and five daughters, moving in the best circles of society.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER V.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>DUTCH SAM (SAMUEL ELIAS).—1801‒1814.</h4>

<p class='c013'>One of the most remarkable boxers of his time was the Israelitish phenomenon
whose name heads this fifth chapter. In height about five feet six
inches and a half; in weight nine stone four pounds, never more than nine
stone eight pounds, Samuel Elias conquered some of the best eleven and
twelve stone men of his time. When stripped Sam looked, in bust and ribs,
more like a twelve stone than a nine stone man, showing he had his muscular
power and weight in the right place. His shoulders were remarkably square,
his arms round, long, muscular and hard; his hands seemed positively of
iron, never puffing or knocking up from the punishing hits inflicted on
his antagonist; while the quickness of his eagle eye, and the fierceness of
his rally were unexampled among his fellow pugilists. A contemporary
writer says: “As a hard hitter we except no pugilist whatever; Gully
never struck with more force, nor Cribb more heavily than Sam, whose
blows were truly dreadful to encounter.” It was the publicly expressed
opinion of one of the most experienced and scientific pugilists of the day, that
Sam would be a complete match for the mighty Cribb himself, if they could
agree to give alternately merely blow for blow. Bill Cropley,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c009'><sup>[101]</sup></a> who was a burly
and game boxer, declared he would rather stand half-an-hour’s milling from
Tom Belcher (see <span class='sc'>Tom Belcher</span> and <span class='sc'>Cropley</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>.), than five minutes
of Sam’s punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Samuel Elias was born on the 4th of April, 1775, in Petticoat Lane,
Whitechapel. As we intend this work, so far as research will make it, to be
reliable history, we shall omit the vamped up skirmishes of Pierce Egan,
which he says “would fill a volume,” and come to the first authentic record
of Sam’s fistic prowess.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c009'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>SAMUEL ELIAS (“DUTCH SAM”), 1801‒1814.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>If, as we conjecture, Sam had fought the battle mentioned below, the
claim, urged by Pierce Egan, for Harry Lee of “first introducing Sam to
the circle of boxers,” is mere bosh. We read in “Boxiana” (vol. i. 301):</p>

<p class='c007'>“Harry Lee, on his return home from Enfield, on the day that Belcher
and Bourke (Joe Berks) were to have fought (October 12, 1801), witnessed
Sam fighting with a man by the roadside, very much his superior as to size
and weight, and from the excellence which he displayed in that contest, Lee
distinguished those peculiar traits in the youthful tyro which have since proved
his judgment correct, and matured by time and practice, placed Sam as a
first-rate boxer, and stamped him a complete pugilistic hero.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In “Fistiana” (we know not on what authority), this battle is elevated to
the dignity of a regular affair, and indexed as “beat Baker, five guineas,
Enfield, October 12, 1801.” Possibly Mr. Dowling, who had access to every
source of information, and was quite another sort of scribe from “the
Historian,” found warrant for the stake and for his chronology.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the exception of one Shipley, who is represented as the “champion
of the Broadway” (Whitechapel), whom he met for a trifling sum in 1803,
we do not hear of Sam in the doings of the ring. Shipley is stated to have
been fourteen stone, “a scientific fighter, and to have beaten every one hitherto
opposed to him.” He laughed at the presumption of Sam in offering to box
with him—and treated the Jew in the most contemptuous manner, by making
Sam a present of five shillings to stand before him for only ten minutes. The
Jew pocketed the cash with the utmost <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>, and after a contest of
fifteen minutes, Shipley experienced such severe punishment that he was
compelled to acknowledge the vast superiority of the arm of this iron-like
pugilist. Warren, an East End boxer of some note, was also beaten, with ease,
by Dutch Sam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Despite “Harry Lee’s patronage,” obtained in 1801, the Hebrew phenomenon’s
entrance upon the regular stage seems to have been delayed till Tuesday,
the 7th of August, 1804, when he met the renowned “Pride of Westminster,”
Caleb Baldwin,<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c009'><sup>[103]</sup></a> at Wood Green, near Hornsey, for a stake of
twenty-five guineas a-side. “On the Monday night it had been resolved that
Fairlop, in Essex, should be the battle-field, but late at night the amateurs
were informed that the ‘beaks’ of the county were up and active to stop the
fight. Accordingly a council was held, Wood Green, near Muswell Hill,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>agreed upon, and towards there equestrians and pedestrians made the best
of their way. On their arrival a ring was quickly formed; but owing to the
delay occasioned by their being obliged to change the scene of action, it was
past one o’clock before the combatants entered. Caleb first made his appearance,
accompanied by George Maddox and Bill Gibbons; Dutch Sam
following with Wood the coachman, the unsuccessful opponent of Bittoon,
for his second, and Puss as his bottle-holder; they immediately
stripped and set-to. Odds two to one in favour of Caleb.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—A little sparring. Sam put in
the first blow with his left hand, but without
effect; Caleb returned with his right, and
following it up, put in a desperate left-handed
hit over Sam’s forehead, and brought
him down. (Odds rose three to one in favour
of Caleb.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Sam shifted, but Caleb stuck to him
manfully, put in two well-aimed blows right
and left, and brought his opponent down the
second time.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—In this round Sam displayed more
resolution, both put in some good hits, and
Caleb’s eye being cut much, bled very freely.
Sam undoubtedly had the best of the round.
(Odds fell two to one on Caleb.)</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—From the last related round to this
was one continued succession of severe hitting
on both sides. Every amateur allowed
that better fighting never was displayed.
Both were cut and bled profusely, but no
one could attribute to either any advantage.
(Betting now became even.)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Caleb put in a successful blow in Sam’s
temple, which completely knocked him down.
Sam putting his hand to his face was considered
ominous of great severity, and odds
rose again on Caleb.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Caleb supported the superiority he
had gained in the last round until this time.
Caleb thought Sam appeared weak, and followed
him up; Sam, however, put in several
severe blows. At the end of this round
Caleb showed great irritability, but Sam
appeared perfectly collected.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Caleb, through his exertions, began
to show symptoms of exhaustion, and to
avoid his antagonist’s blows, frequently endeavoured
to close, and while struggling for
the fall, Sam by a peculiar mode struck his
blows upwards, which told dreadfully in
Caleb’s face.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c009'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>23.—For the last three rounds Caleb
evinced great distress. After making a blow
or two, he was so excessively weak, as
scarcely to be able to keep his hands straight
before him; he, however, still put in his
blows, but devoid of any force. Sam, on
the contrary, seemed to gain fresh vigour
from his opponent’s exhaustion, and gave no
quarter.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—Sam now began to display imbecility,
and both hit each other blow after blow
without making any impression, and so
completely were both combatants served out,
that neither came to their time. Sam,
however appeared least bruised, and the
odds were slightly betted in his favour. In
this round Sam displayed all that heroism
and manly conduct which characterise the
courageous pugilist. Having put in a most
severe blow on his opponent’s head, over his
guard, which stunned him, he was prepared
to follow it by a right-handed hit, but desisted,
drawing back his hand on seeing his
adversary was already falling. Every one
present applauded the generosity of the
action.</p>

<p class='c022'>From this to the 37th round, which closed
the contest, Caleb fell off in strength; and
in his distress several times fell from losing
his balance or missing a blow. He became
sick, and finally the luckless champion of
Westminster was carried off almost insensible.
Sam towards the close fought upon
the saving system, husbanding his strength.
The reporter adds, “in this unequal state of
things, it was undoubtedly very wrong to
bring Caleb to face his man, who, poor fellow,
came willingly up to the last, though
he could not hold up his hands, much less
hit a blow.” The ring was broken by Caleb’s
friends, on a claim of “foul,” “but the umpires
would not be imposed upon by so stale
a trick, and declared Sam to be the conqueror.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Caleb, assigning illness as the cause of his defeat, proposed a second trial
with Sam. Accordingly in September a match was made for twenty guineas
a-side. Sam however assigned “business reasons” for declining, and forfeited
the deposit down.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Saturday, the 27th April, 1805, there were three battles decided at
Shepperton, Surrey. The first between Pearce, the Game Chicken, and
Carte, of Birmingham; the second between Tom Belcher and O’Donnell; the
third between our hero, and Britton of Bristol. For this battle of thirty rounds,
Sam was, according to the report, totally unprepared; indeed he was positively
inebriated when it began. Britton was introduced as “a yokel” who
was ready to fight for a purse. A spectator says, “For the first four rounds
Britton held a lead, when Sam was given to understand that his adversary was
a <em>plant</em> upon him. Sam nodded his head, and forcing his man to fight, in a
rapid rally dealt out such severe punishment that Britton went down almost
done over. Sam’s conduct in this fight was most singular. After milling
poor Britton down, he threw himself by his side, and patting him on the
back, exclaimed “What, you are a <em>plant</em> are you? S’elp me Cot, I’ll soon
<em>plant</em> you;” and once during the battle when Britton rushed wildly in, Sam,
with the utmost contempt, threw up both his open hands, calling out to the
spectators, “See the vay this <em>plant</em> is trying to kiss me,” and then stepping
back quickly, he hit Britton clean off his legs!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam’s fame now spread far and wide; but it would be utterly inconsistent
with the character we would wish to impress upon this work, were we to
omit a circumstance which occurred about this time, in which the pre-eminence
of Dutch Sam was successfully disputed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the month of June, 1805, Sam was in training at Thames-Ditton, and
on his way to town, over Wimbledon Common, he met one James Brown,
a butcher of Wandsworth. A quarrel, how originating we have no account,
ensued; and after some altercation, Sam, expecting to strike terror into his
opponent, informed him he was “Dutch Sam.” The man very calmly
answered as they stood in attitude, “Be you the devil as well, I’ll bang you,
now I am at it,” and nobly he kept his word, for he brought Sam down
with such terrible arguments every round, that Sam at the close of a dozen
bouts, acknowledged he would have “no more of it”; adding that he was
beaten for the first time in his life.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c009'><sup>[105]</sup></a> Such a casual turn-up as this proves
surely that Brown was a natural boxer, as well as a plucky, game, strong,
and active fellow; Sam’s reasons for not going on, need hardly be dwelt
on, as he was in training to fight Tom Belcher. He was, however, very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>much mortified, and deservedly so, when the affair got into the newspapers.</p>

<p class='c007'>After two postponements, Sam’s match with the celebrated Tom Belcher,
was brought to an issue. In our memoir of John Gully, the reader will
find the accident narrated which led to one of the postponements. Sam,
it was thought by many, considered Belcher too clever as well as too big for
him, and wished to shirk the encounter; when unexpectedly, at the latter
end of January, Belcher received a challenge from Sam to fight for 100
guineas, naming the 8th of the following month, if suitable. Tom instantly
accepted the offer, and his friends covered Sam’s hundred golden pieces, with
the most sanguine hopes of the result.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virginia Water was settled as the rendezvous, and accordingly, on
Saturday morning, the 8th of February, 1806, all the amateurs attended, held
a short consultation, and decided Sendon Heath, near the village of Thorpe,
as the field of battle.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c009'><sup>[106]</sup></a> The combatants immediately repaired there, a rope
ring was formed, and Dutch Sam entered, attended by Dan Mendoza for his
second, and Tom Blake, bottle-holder. Tom Belcher soon followed with
John Gully and Dick Whale. Betting was lively, but no odds offered. At
one o’clock the heroes set-to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Sam made a feint. Belcher
put in a good hit; Sam returned it, and
Belcher, putting in another blow, overreached
himself and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Belcher put in two good hits right and
left. Sam struck in return, but slightly;
they closed, and both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Sam aimed a well-directed blow at
his opponent’s ribs; Belcher parried well,
and with his right put in a tolerably good
hit; they closed and fell. (Odds five to four
on Belcher.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—A good round. Sam was very gay,
went in and rallied; but Belcher parried
most of his blows with his left hand, while
he advantageously used his right. Many
blows were exchanged, when Sam, by dint
of superior activity, threw his antagonist.
(Betting again even.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Belcher put in two slight blows, and
in the struggle fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—An obstinately contested round, but
much in favour of Tom. Sam went in and
rallied; Belcher shifted, and stopped his
hits, which were truly desperate, with great
dexterity.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Belcher rallied, and put in a most
severe blow on the temple. Sam, however,
stood firmly, and returned it on the eye;
they closed, and both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Belcher’s eye evidently showed the
force with which Sam’s blow had been
struck. Some good blows exchanged, and
Belcher threw his opponent. (Odds two to
one in favour of Tom.)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Belcher appeared fatigued. Sam ran
in, avoided rallying, and by jobbing at his
antagonist’s head and throat, knocked him
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Belcher made some ineffectual attempts
at his adversary’s head. Sam rallied,
and Belcher fell through weakness. (Odds
now changed in favour of Sam seven to four.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Sam put in some good hits, which
were well parried by Belcher. They closed
and both fell, Sam uppermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Belcher exerted himself, and appeared
not so much distressed in his wind;
all Belcher’s blows were very feeble, and he
again fell seemingly exhausted. (Odds were
now two to one on Sam.)</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Belcher recruited, and put in two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>good blows on his opponent’s head, Sam
now appeared rather shy. Belcher went in
and threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>14 and 15.—No blows either round. Sam
still shy, and evinced fatigue. Bets level
again, Belcher being known to be game.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—A good round. Sam, in a passion,
went in and followed Belcher round the
ring, who put in several good blows.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—On this round Tom displayed excellent
science; threw in some good hits, but
appeared very weak. (Odds six to five on
Belcher.)</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Belcher kept up a slight superiority.
Both combatants very much exhausted, and
their hits made no impression.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Sam very shy; did not face his adversary.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—Belcher immediately made play at
the face, and put in a good hit, and terminated
the round by throwing his opponent.
(Odds rose in Tom’s favour.)</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—Belcher in this round was so much
exhausted, that all hopes of victory on his
part were relinquished.</p>

<p class='c022'>The contest was, however, spun out to the
fifty-seventh round, when Belcher, severely
punished, was forced to yield, not having
strength enough to keep him on his
legs.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This was, without dispute,
one of the best contested and most skilful
battles that ever had been witnessed. Sam
proved himself a truly desperate hitter, and
a very powerful man; to the latter quality
may principally be attributed his success,
for notwithstanding Tom Belcher was this
day unfortunate, he stands as one of the
prettiest fighters of the day; great allowance
also must be made for his indisposition.
Sam fought greatly in the Mendoza
style, and his having that excellent pugilist
at his elbow was no mean advantage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The friends of Belcher considered this battle by no means decisive of the
men’s merits. Belcher himself urged that he was labouring under a debilitating
disorder, and moreover that the notice was too short for proper
preparation. They proposed to fight for 200 guineas, and named Tuesday,
July 28th, 1807, as the day.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c009'><sup>[107]</sup></a> Moulsey Hurst was the fixture, and as early
as nine o’clock in the morning a roped ring was formed, twenty-eight feet
in diameter, but before twelve o’clock it was found that the space allotted
to pedestrians would not hold the immense concourse attending, and two
hours were employed in removing to a more convenient place. As soon as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the ring was completed, Belcher entered, attended by Bill Warr and Watson;
Dutch Sam soon followed, with Mendoza and Bittoon. In a few minutes the
combatants set-to, both appearing in good confidence as to the result.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Not much ceremony in sparring.
Sam made a hit at Tom’s ribs, which
fell short, and Tom put in two desperate
blows at his opponent’s head, and retreated.
Both now sparred very cautiously; Sam
rallied, they closed, and both fell, Sam
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Sam threw away many hits, at length
put in a good right-hand blow in Belcher’s
loins, which Tom returned by a severe hit
in the face. Cautious sparring again, and
Sam put in a desperate blow in the neck,
and brought his adversary down. (Even
betting yet.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Sam stood up with great courage and
confidence; both put in some good hits,
which were dexterously parried. Sam went
in, and closing threw Belcher again.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Belcher showed some marks of severe
blows in the last rally, and bled profusely at
the nose; Sam was not without a few evidences
of his opponent’s skill, his eye was
dreadfully swelled. Belcher put in a very
clean blow over his opponent’s guard, in the
face, when Sam closed, and threw Tom with
great violence.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—It would be difficult to describe the
courage and skill displayed in this round.
Sam rallied, some good hits exchanged, and
they closed; again disengaged, and Belcher
rallied, but Sam had a most decided advantage
throughout the round, driving his opponent
to all parts of the ring, and at length
brought Belcher down by a very feeble blow.
(Odds five to four on Sam, but betting shy.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—This was also an excellently contested
round. After some blows had been exchanged,
Sam put in two forcible blows at
Belcher’s head, which were well stopped,
but he fell, apparently very weak. (Odds
six to four on Sam.)</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Sam appeared to judge his distances
very badly, frequently striking short blows;
they closed very irregularly, but Sam threw
Belcher, and pitched him on his head.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—In this round Belcher gained considerable
advantage, hit his antagonist severely
in the face right and left, and after
another very irregular close, threw Sam as
heavy a fall as he had before experienced.
Sam, however, still remained the favourite.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Sam made a long body hit, and threw
his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Sam made two attempts at Belcher’s
head, both of which were dexterously parried.
After Sam had thrown away several
blows they closed, and Belcher threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Belcher appeared fresher, but was
very cautious; he retreated round the ring;
Sam followed him closely, and ran him down
on the spot.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Sam made two unsuccessful hits,
which were again stopped, and Belcher returned
one with great violence; by a slight
hit Sam fell, and evinced great distress.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—On setting to, it was observed Sam
had two black eyes, and Belcher showed
severe punishment on his left side. Sam
repeated a hit on this spot, and Belcher
immediately closed and threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Belcher retreated; Sam followed;
no fighting; a hugging close, and Belcher
fell, seemingly from weakness. (Odds seven
to four on Sam.)</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—A good rallying round, and some
good blows made. Sam put in a good hit
in the throat, and they closed, and Belcher
threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>17 and 18.—No blow of importance.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—A hard fought round; each exerted
himself to the utmost, and excellent blows
were exchanged in a rally at arm’s length,
until both fell, as though it had been preconcerted.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Sam hit Belcher on the nose, but was
thrown in closing.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—A desperate round, all rallying at
arm’s length, each hitting and stopping.
Sam had the advantage, Belcher being very
weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—In this round Belcher exerted his
utmost, followed his opponent with great
courage, and displayed great skill in hitting
and stopping.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—At the end of this round very faint
hopes were entertained for Belcher’s success.
Sam made play, rallied, and hit three severe
blows on Tom’s left side; Tom, however,
threw him. (Odds three to one on Sam.)</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—Greatly in favour of Sam, who put in
several severe blows on Belcher’s head, and
he fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—A good round. Sam still kept the
superiority; Belcher’s blows were too feeble
to make any impression. Sam threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—Sam appeared in great spirits, and
as fresh as ever, but his eyes were almost
closed. He rallied, and Tom, being almost
exhausted, was knocked down. (Odds four
to one on Sam.)</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—Every one felt commiseration for
Tom. His exertions to maintain the fight
received applause, and were truly courageous;
but Sam, elated at the state to which
he had reduced his opponent, mustering all
fire, beat him out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>32.—Belcher struck twice, but very feebly,
and in vainly endeavouring to rally, fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—Tom had no chance whatever, his
blows were perfectly useless. He fell without
receiving a blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>34.—This was the last round, and it unfortunately
created a dispute. Belcher made
a blow at Sam, and fell on his knees; Sam
made a hit, intending to strike his adversary
while on his legs and before his hands
reached the earth; Sam’s blow reached him
while on his knees. A cry of “Foul” was
immediately raised, particularly by those on
the wrong side with their bets, and the
matter was referred to the two umpires.
One of these declared it “fair,” the other
“foul.” Mr. Jackson now stepped forward
and explained that a man was not to be
considered down until his hand had reached
the floor, consequently the blow was fair,
and Sam must be acknowledged the conqueror.
“Notwithstanding this flowing declaration
of Jackson’s,” says the reporter,
“the umpires, Captain Barclay and the
Hon. Berkeley Craven, agreed to refer the
matter to Lord Say and Sele. His lordship
declined giving a decision, when Lord Archibald
Hamilton was immediately solicited,
and he undertook the office of judge of
appeal. Many meetings of the amateurs
took place, and the subject of this foul play
was warmly discussed. The rules of Broughton
and all the first rate authorities were
adduced, but the only case considered as in
point throughout the annals of pugilism, was
that of Humphries and Mendoza, in the
battle they fought at Stilton, in May, 1789
(see p. 73); but from the irritability of
Mendoza, the battle in that case was renewed.
An offer was now made to Sam to
draw stakes, but this was refused, on the
plea that, if even Belcher was on his knees,
he was doing his best still on the defensive.
At length it was agreed on all sides that
there should be a new trial.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The third meeting accordingly was arranged for the 21st August, 1807.
The men met at Lowfield Common, near Crawley, Sussex, in a thirty feet
ring upon the turf. In the articles it was specified that the following article
of Broughton’s rules should be decisive:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“7.—That no person is to hit his adversary when down, or seize him by the ham, the
breeches, or any part below the waist: a man on his knees to be reckoned down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sam was seconded by Mendoza, and Bittoon was his bottle-holder. Tom
Belcher was attended by Gully and Ward.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Considerable anxiety was manifested
upon the combatants setting to, and
the interested spectators were much agitated
with hopes and fears, upon the decision of
this third contest between two such distinguished
pugilists. Sam made a feint with
his left hand, and endeavoured with his right
to hit Tom’s ribs; but they were stopped,
and Belcher returned feebly with his left
hand; in closing, Sam was underneath.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Sam going in to rally. Tom hit him
right and left, and likewise stopped two
blows. In closing, Belcher was thrown.
(Betting now commenced—five to two on
Sam.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Sam extremely cautious till he had
got his proper distance, when, after making
a left-handed feint, he put in a terrible blow
under Belcher’s left eye that brought the
claret out in abundance, and its effects were
so severe that Tom was confused, and,
upon exchanging a hit, was thrown. (Three
to one on Sam.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Both rallying, and exchanging hits at
arm’s length; no advantage on either side;
but the strength of Sam was prominent in
closing. He threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—A most excellent round, but rather in
favour of Belcher. Sam rallied, but without
effect, as Belcher hit him off. Notwithstanding,
Sam closed, disengaged, and commenced
another rally, when Tom put in a
most tremendous blow upon the left eye of his
opponent, and also threw him a heavy fall.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Desperate fighting; both exhausted,
and fell together.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Belcher put in two slight hits; when
they closed irregularly and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Rallying and good science on both
sides; hitting and stopping in good style,
till they both fell. Belcher manifested first
weakness.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Sam incorrect in his distances; Belcher
gave him a severe fall. (Four to one
on Sam.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Belcher hit his opponent slightly,
when Sam threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Sam, full of strength, rallied desperately,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>which was followed up by Tom, but
in favour of the Jew. Sam’s blows were
dreadful, and Belcher’s face and body suffered
materially. He fell from weakness.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—No blows given. Tom ran himself
down. (All betters, but no one sanguine
enough to take them.)</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Sam followed the style of his opponent,
and ran himself down.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Belcher somewhat shy from the
severe beating he had received. He fell
from two of Sam’s right-handed body blows.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Belcher made every effort to put in
some good hits, but they were too feeble to
do execution. He fell from weakness, while
rallying.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Of no importance, except both the
combatants, after closing, appeared to fall
from exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Belcher, in attempting to hit his
opponent, was stopped, and, in closing, Tom
fell between his adversary’s arms on his
knees. Sam, who was strongly impressed
with the articles, cleverly held up his hands,
to show that no foul blows should put an
end to this contest.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Sam, in closing, got his opponent’s
head under his arm, and fibbed Belcher so
severely that he dropped.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Tom fell on his knees; but Sam was
on his guard, and only smiled.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Sam beat his opponent to the ropes
with considerable ease.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Belcher still giving way under Sam’s
superior strength.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—Belcher, rather recovered, obtained
some little advantage.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Belcher, still livelier, contended
spiritedly, till they both fell and lay along
on the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Belcher completely astonished his
friends by his fine game and resolution, and
obtained advantage in a desperate rally,
when they both fell, quite exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Tom’s excellence in the science of
boxing was truly conspicuous in this round;
his blows were well directed, but not effective.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—Sam, to avoid Tom’s favourite right-handed
body blow, threw himself on his face.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—Sam received a heavy fall, after some
irregular fighting.</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—Belcher claimed considerable respect
and attention, from the fine style in which
he gained the superiority over his opponent,
and also in giving Sam a very severe fall.</p>

<p class='c022'>29 and 30.—Good rallies took place in both
these rounds; rather in favour of Belcher.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the thirty-first to the thirty-sixth
round it was evident to the spectators that
Belcher could not win. The onslaughts of Sam
were tremendous in the extreme. He followed
his opponent to all parts of the ring,
putting in dreadful facers and body blows,
dealing out punishment till his brave opponent
fell, quite exhausted. His brother Jem
took him out of the ring in the most feeble
state, and placed him in a gentleman’s
chariot. It was on the left side, from the
kidneys to the crown of the head, where
Tom was so severely beaten. Sam’s principal
injury was a blow under the left eye,
and some trifling marks. The Dutchman
dressed himself with perfect indifference before
he left the ring. The superiority of
Sam’s hitting, and the severity of his blows,
were visible throughout this battle. Belcher’s
skill was apparent, but there was no
comparison in the effectiveness of the two
men’s mode of fighting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bill Cropley, as yet unconquered, challenged Dutch Sam for fifty guineas,
and was accepted. The battle was fixed for April 5, 1808, the same day as
that between Belcher and Dogherty, but the officers from Bow Street,
appeared with special warrants, and took Sam and his opponent into custody;
they were then bound over to keep the peace in four contiguous counties
named in the bonds.</p>

<p class='c007'>A new arrangement was therefore entered into, and on the 10th May,
1808, after Gully’s memorable defeat of Gregson, Sam and Cropley entered
the enclosure and immediately set-to. Cropley stood over Sam in an alarming
manner, and in the first round caught Sam heavily on the eye. On this
success, however, he never improved; he tried every manœuvre to get at his
head again, but ineffectually; Sam always got away, and punished him
cuttingly for following him up. In twenty-five minutes Cropley was a
piteous spectacle, and by the advice of his seconds, gave in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam’s irregularity of living, and what he called his “gin training,” began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>now to tell upon his wonderful constitution; and though his name is of continual
recurrence in affairs of the ring during two years, it is not until a
quarrel again brought him within the ropes in May, 1810, that Sam publicly
doffed his shirt. A series of bickerings and slight disputes had led to an
ill feeling between Sam and a tradesman of the name of Medley, for many
years after known in sporting circles. These at last came to a crisis in a
challenge from Medley, to fight for 200 guineas, Medley putting down his
own money. The affair created immense excitement at the time. The
<cite>Daily Advertiser</cite> thus notices Sam’s opponent: “Ben Medley, as he is called
by his intimates, is a muscular man, some twenty pounds heavier than
Samuels (Elias). He has never before entered the ring for a stake, but fame
records great things of him in resenting a personal injury, and as a setter-to
with the gloves his excellence is well known at the Fives Court. Sam has
regarded this fame so much, that, to avoid risking a chance, he preferred
to forfeit some time ago, because he did not think himself in good condition
at the appointed time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Famed Moulsey Hurst, on the 31st May, 1810, was crowded to excess,
and it was with great difficulty that the ring could be kept clear. At one
o’clock the champions entered, Sam waited on by Harry Lee and Puss;
Joe Ward and Tom Cribb seconded Medley. They were not long in stripping.
The betting varied, but the current price was two to one on Sam.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—After a little sparring Sam put
in a left-handed hit, which Medley stopped
cleverly; they closed, but disengaged themselves.
Medley stopped Sam’s left again,
closed, and threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Medley led off. They closed and
broke away. Sam got in a left-hander on
the ribs, and following it up, forced a rally,
in which he caught Medley a tremendous
blow on the temple. Medley fought hurriedly,
and slipt down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Medley appeared quite confused from
the violence of the blow on his temple. It
evidently had taken much of the fight out of
him. He, however, stood up with courage,
and rallied. Sam stopped with great dexterity,
and by a well planted hit under the
chin, knocked Medley off his legs. (Odds
four to one on Sam.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Medley rallied, but Sam brought him
down by a body blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Medley struck; Sam parried, and
threw in right and left; both hits told.
They closed, and Sam threw Medley by dint
of superior strength.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Medley’s eye was greatly swollen; he
appeared shy, retreated. Sam, however,
waited for his coming up, and threw in a
violent blow on the face, which re-echoed
again; they closed, and Sam threw Medley
again.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Sam quite gay, went in, and putting
in a most tremendous blow in the breast,
brought his opponent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Medley bled profusely. Sam was
coming in to rally, when Medley knocked him
down and laughed at him; but his countenance
was ghastly, from the tremendous
blows he had received in the face.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Sam appeared angry, ran in, and
missed his distance. Medley displayed a
great deal of science, but was at last
knocked down.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Medley was making play, when Sam
knocked him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—An excellent round, and the longest
in the battle. Medley showed weakness, yet
he put in a good hit on Sam’s nose, who
directly knocked him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—It would be impossible to describe
the spectacle Medley’s face and head exhibited,
the blood flowing in all directions.
Before any blow was struck Medley fell from
weakness.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>13.—Medley was again making play, when
Sam put in a severe blow in the ribs, and
Medley again fell. His side now began to
swell.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Sam slipped, but it was thought a
trick to gain wind.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Sam went in and rallied. Medley
very weak, but gamely bored in upon Sam,
who continued plying right and left until
Medley fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>Notwithstanding Medley was in this dreadful
state, he continued the fight for thirty-three
more rounds; but nature being at
length exhausted, and his wounds bleeding
beyond the skill of his second’s stopping, his
brother declared him conquered.</p>

<p class='c022'>Sam in this battle displayed great science,
and his mercy to his opponent did him still
greater honour. Medley showed game, but
his hits were too light for a fighter, being in
fact the taps of the sparring school.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sam now resolved to retire from the ring as a principal. He was thirty-five
years of age, and had always fought what is termed “up-hill;” that
is, men of greater weight and size than himself. It would have been well
for him had he adhered to this resolution, as we shall presently see.</p>

<p class='c007'>Five years had elapsed during which Sam’s intemperance was the subject
of regret among his acquaintance, when Bill Nosworthy, the baker, a wrestler
and boxer of some repute with the “dead men” of the metropolis, offered
himself to Sam’s notice; by whom, as we have already said, the poet’s
warning was as unheeded as it was probably unknown:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, in my youth, I never did apply</div>
      <div class='line'>Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood:</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor did I, with unbashful forehead, woo</div>
      <div class='line'>The means of weakness and debility;</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,</div>
      <div class='line'>Frosty, but kindly.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This, Sam’s final ring encounter, took place at Moulsey, on Tuesday,
December 8th, 1814. Four to one had been betted on Sam previous to this
fight, and he was backed, when fighting, till near the end of the battle, by
the best judges in the pugilistic circles.</p>

<p class='c007'>This defeat (which will be found detailed in the Appendix to Period IV.,
under <span class='sc'>Nosworthy</span>), ruined him, and he sunk into dejection, misery, and
want. Like many others of the headstrong race of hard drinkers, he was
infatuated with the idea that nothing in the shape of excess could harm his
iron frame. Indeed, Sam had been heard insanely to boast that he could
train on “three glasses of gin, three times a day.” What wonder, then,
that he fell? Excess, pride, and conceit destroyed his vigour and stamina,
and on this occasion he might exclaim,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’ve touched the highest point of all my greatness,</div>
      <div class='line'>And from that full meridian of my glory,</div>
      <div class='line'>I haste now to my setting.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A few anecdotes from contemporary sources may show Sam’s fistic
capabilities even in his decadence. Passing through Wapping, one evening,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>when it was almost dark, he observed a poor Jew and a sailor fighting, and,
upon enquiring the cause, he was soon recognized by the unfortunate
Mordecai, who had been several times floored by the rough son of Neptune.
Sam stooped to pick up his Israelitish brother, when the latter whispered in
his ear, “So help my Cot, Sam, I can’t fight any more.” “Hold your
tongue, you fool,” replied Sam, at the same time falling down by his side:
“you get up and pretend to pick me up: I’ll let fly at him.” This imposition
was practised with success, and Sam, staggering on to his legs with
well feigned grogginess, went bang in with his one-two at the Jack Tar, in
such style that he saluted mother earth in a twinkling. The sailor, upon
getting upon his pins, roughly exclaimed, “D—— my ——, this ain’t the
man I was fighting with—it’s another. Shiver me, but his blows are like
the kicks of a horse—I’ll have no more of this.” He instantly sheered off,
while Sam and his friend dropped into a neighbouring gin-shop to laugh over
the trick.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible correctly to ascertain the number of bye-battles in which
Sam was engaged; but it is certainly within compass to assert, that he
fought above one hundred.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the vicinity of St. George’s Fields, a stout fellow of the name of Jones,
a painter, and a neighbour of Dutch Sam’s, who valued himself upon his
milling qualities, publicly declared that he was the champion of that quarter,
and frequently had importuned Sam to have a set-to; the latter always
declined. It happened one evening that Sam was regaling himself at a
public-house, and glass succeeding glass of Deady’s brilliant fluid, had nearly
obliterated worldly things from Sam’s pericranium, when Jones, learning
the circumstance, entered the premises, and endeavoured to provoke him to a
combat, but in vain. At length Jones struck him. This was too much, the
staggering Sam returned it, and inquired “whether he was doing right or
wrong to defend himself?” An adjournment to the street took place, when
Sam, notwithstanding his intoxicated state, appeared to have the advantage,
until Jones, seizing him by the hair of his head, threw him down, and struck
him violently upon the stones. This unmanly act appeared to have a most
unusual and electric effect, for it awoke Sam to a recollection of what he was
about; and, to the surprise of the spectators, the Israelite started up exclaiming,
“Take care, take care, I’m coming now!” put in such a bodier as
nearly deprived Jones of his breath, following it up by a slashing hit over
his eye, which levelled the brute in his congenial mud. Utterly flabbergasted
by the severity and impetuosity of Sam’s hitting, he fairly bolted.
Jones weighed thirteen stone six pounds; and, though destitute of propriety,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>was not without pretensions to science; this lesson taught him summarily
the folly of vain boasting, and the superiority of a master in the art.</p>

<p class='c007'>We cannot omit one bright trait in Sam’s character, and this was his
honest determination to win his fight if he could. We read in his obituary
notice, “Sam’s integrity was a bright jewel; it was undoubtedly of the first
water; he was once tampered with by a large offer to lose a fight (Egan says
1000<em>l.</em>), but he at once disclosed the affair to his backers. If all our pugilists
had displayed the like honesty, the ring would be in a very different state.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam’s constitution originally was of the finest quality, and his strength, for
his stature and weight, amazing. The day he fought with Cropley he asserted
that he was able to “floor an ox.” The Game Chicken once affronted Sam,
when the latter informed that formidable boxer that he could not beat him
in a quarter of an hour. In private life, Sam possessed a good deal of comic
humour; and he passed much of his latter time in the service of Saunders,
the equestrian circus keeper, of Bartholomew Fair notoriety.</p>

<p class='c007'>He suffered considerably in his illness, and died in the London Hospital,
on Wednesday, July 3, 1816, in the forty-second year of his age. He was
buried on the 4th of the same month, in the Jews’ burying ground, Whitechapel.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a boxer, “take him for all in all,” while he lived he had no equal;
but latterly his stamina was utterly ruined by excessive indulgence in ardent
spirits.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>GEORGE MADDOX (KNOWN IN HIS LATER BATTLES AS “THE VETERAN”)—1792‒1809.</h4>

<p class='c013'>As a connecting link between the Second and Third Periods, George
Maddox furnishes a career of some interest. He was a civil, facetious,
illiterate man, but possessed of manly courage and forbearance. “Though,”
says one who knew him, “George Maddox fought more battles than any
man I knew of his time, he never had a spark of resentment in his composition.
His hardihood and resolution in the battle were not more remarkable
than the coolness, almost stoical, with which he spoke of victory or defeat,
in his own natural and rough manner. He seemed satisfied, that having
done his best, the best could do no more, and generally spoke strongly of the
‘goodness’ of the men who had given in to him.” Maddox was born in
Tothill Fields, Westminster, in 1756. In his fiftieth year he entered the
lists with the powerful Tom Cribb, then in the prime of his youth and
freshness, and, after fighting an hour and a half, the odds were still in his
favour. Seventy-six rounds and two hours and ten minutes of courageous
fighting passed before “the Veteran” cried “enough!” Once more in his
fifty-fifth year he met Bill Richmond, the black (whom he had formerly
beaten in three rounds), and after an hour yielded to exhaustion. The spirit
did not surrender, but nature left him.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c009'><sup>[108]</sup></a> There can be nothing added to
this but the record of George’s boxing career.</p>

<p class='c007'>George Maddox was as modest and independent as he was courageous.
He never hung about sporting public-houses or low tap-rooms, and never
sponged upon gentlemen, nor sought the patronage of the great. After a
memorable fight he sunk into his desired obscurity, following his humble
occupation, and content with his moderate earnings, as an industrious
costermonger, a calling much more lucrative and numerous than in our times.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Indeed the “donkey dragoons” of Westminster, as they were then termed,
formed a formidable squadron; and, among the lower classes, the proprietor
of a “neddy and tumbler”—as in the days of slang a donkey and cart were
termed—was often a velveteened fancy-dressed person with gold as well as
silver and copper in his pocket, or “skin,” a taste for “the Fancy,” an
attendant at every sport, the owner of a “tyke” or two, and a “dealer
in curiosities,”—rats, squirrels, ferrets, badgers, an occasional mongoose,
and fancy “pets,” coming particularly within the range of his tastes and
trading.</p>

<p class='c007'>After many bye-battles, Maddox’s first regular contest was with Symonds
(the Ruffian). This took place at Datchet, near Windsor, on Saturday,
December 4, 1792. See <span class='sc'>Symonds</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, 130.</p>

<p class='c007'>This battle stands unparalleled for desperation and unflinching resolution
in the annals of pugilism. The spot first named was Langley Broom, in
Buckinghamshire, but magisterial interference preventing the rencontre,
“the wayfarers crossed the Thames carrying their boards and quartering
with them, and in a very few minutes erected a stage,” in the renowned
Shaksperian “Datchet Mead.” We must here remark, that Maddox was
two inches shorter and more than two stone lighter than Symonds, to
appreciate the battle which followed. There is no report worthy of
transcription of this tremendous fight which is described in generalities.
“Columns of our paper would not suffice to detail the rallies, the knock-down
blows, the alternate advantages and the gluttony which marked this
surprising battle. ‘The Ruffian,’ who was nearly two stone heavier than
his antagonist, was by far the most beaten, and totally blind, from the closing
of both his eyes, before he would allow himself to be carried from off the
stage. Maddox, of course, was not quite in so desperate a condition, as he
had the best of the hitting in the rallies, especially towards the latter rounds.
It was stated by an experienced amateur that Maddox put in two, sometimes
three blows to Symonds’s one throughout the contest,” which lasted two
hours, during which 100 rounds were fought.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Monday, February 10, 1794, Maddox met Hooper, the tinman, but
after a game fight of nearly an hour, surrendered to that formidable boxer.
(See <span class='sc'>Hooper</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 107.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Isaac Bittoon, a Jew, known for many years after to the visitors of the
Fives Court and sparring saloons of the metropolis, was Maddox’s next
opponent. Bittoon’s qualifications as a boxer will be found noticed under
his name. The battle came off on Monday, December 13th, 1802, on
Wimbledon Common. The ground first named was Wormwood Scrubs, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“on arriving there a goodly posse of the Bow Street runners, with a
number of special constables, had possession of the ground. A council of
war now directed that each man’s party should separate and meet again
at the five-mile-stone on the Edgware road, to elude the vigilance of the
myrmidons of the law. When George and his friends reached the rendezvous,
no Jew was there, and they waited two hours in anxious expectation. All
hopes of a battle that day were given up, when a messenger on horseback
arrived with the information that Bittoon was waiting for his opponent at
Wimbledon Common, when off went gig, cart, curricle, carriage, buggy, and
tumbler, over Putney Bridge, on a visit once again to the shrine of Jerry
Abbershaw. At a quarter before three the pilgrims arrived, the ring was
formed, and precisely at five minutes before three they set-to. Bittoon was
seconded by Lyons, and Maddox by Joe Ward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For the first three rounds the Jew had a clear advantage, having three
successive times brought down his opponent at the close of the round, but
not without some sharp returns. The combatants manœuvred, then laid aside
science for a display of unflinching courage, forcing the fighting rapidly,
taking and giving heavily; but in this the agility of Maddox and his superior
quickness in advancing and retreating brought the odds to seven to four in his
favour. From the sixty-eighth to the seventy-third round, Bittoon recovered
strength and well supported the contest. In the seventy-fourth round he
threw Maddox heavily, who was also sadly beaten both in the face and
body. It was now getting dark, and Maddox persevered to make it a
‘draw.’ Maddox’s brother and friends now entered the ring and stopped
the battle, stating that no one could see fair. A general engagement with
sticks and fists ensued, to clear the ring. A parley ensued, when it was
agreed the battle should be postponed to a future day; the men having been
engaged one hour and ten minutes, and fought seventy-four rounds, the
seventy-fifth being interrupted as above stated.” The reporter adds, “in
the fight both men displayed ‘bottom’ unequalled in the annals of pugilism.”
At a further conference between the backers of the men, they humanely
decided, that two such brave and evenly matched men should not meet again
for the same stake, but each have his backer’s stake-money.</p>

<p class='c007'>George, now, as on former occasions, like Caleb Baldwin and others of his
time, returned to his humble and laborious calling. He however, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">more
majorum</span></i>, attended whenever there was a “good thing” on. Thus, on the 23rd
January, 1804, he was present at the celebrated fight of the Game Chicken and
Joe Berks, on Putney Common. The great event disposed of, a purse was got
up, and Maddox, then called “the Veteran,” offered himself as a candidate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>One Seabrook, a dustman, and a bounceable sort of chap, long known as a
second rate pugilist, was induced by the offer of four pounds to enter the ring
with George. The affair was a farce, Maddox punished Seabrook all over the
ring for three rounds, when he fell out of the ropes and declared his arm was
broken. “No sooner, however, had he nibbed the gull (Anglicè pocketed
the money), than he boastingly swore he was not the least hurt.”<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c009'><sup>[109]</sup></a> “Pancratia,”
p. 199.</p>

<p class='c007'>George’s day’s work was not, however, yet over. Bill Richmond, an
athletic American black, of whom we shall hear more hereafter, who had
served his time to a cabinet maker at York, and was at this time footman to
the well-known Lord Camelford, having expressed himself desirous of a
“shy” with a professed pugilist, was indulged by the deposit of a small
stake. The affair, like that of Seabrook’s, was of three rounds only. In
the last round Maddox caught Richmond an electrifying blow under the left
eye, which in the words of the reporter, “so completely <em>queered his ogle</em>, that
he at once gave in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>George, though now in his fiftieth year, was always ready to try “a
novice.” At a meeting at Wood Green, near Hornsey, on Monday, June 7,
1805, a subscription purse was offered of twenty-five guineas, twenty for the
winner, five for the loser. For this Tom Cribb, “the Black Diamond,”
offered himself. The battle will be detailed under Cribb. His after-renowned
opponent, besides the advantages of youth, was two inches taller
than George. Maddox fought like a hero, and gave in with reluctance, after
two hours and ten minutes’ combat, with a stalwart and game youngster with
stamina fresh and unwasted. Maddox fell gloriously, and Young Cribb, hitherto
unknown, by this contest acquired a pugilistic fame that soon developed
itself, and ultimately led him to the championship.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Monday, June 5th, 1806, three boxing matches were decided at Padnal
Corner, Epping Forest. The second of these was between George Maddox,
“the Veteran,” and Coady,<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c009'><sup>[110]</sup></a> an Irish boxer, of great pretence, for forty
guineas. Maddox was considered “gone by,” and Coady made the favourite.
We copy the report from the <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>: “Maddox fought in the old
style, that of rallying,<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c009'><sup>[111]</sup></a> and in a great measure giving the first powerful hit
in each round. Coady always waited for him to begin, and generally hit in
return successfully in the rallies. His blows did not, however, seem to tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>so much or to be put in so sharply as his adversary’s. After the combat had
lasted half an hour there was some confusion, and the ring was broken in,
but whether by design or accident could not be discovered. The combatants
were, however, taken away until another ring was formed, when they again
set-to. The combat lasted another three quarters of an hour, when a detachment
of the 10th Light Dragoons appeared, headed by a magistrate, who,
being also headborough, entered the ring, and with all the moderation and
gentlemanly affability becoming his authority addressed the amateurs,
informing them they must disperse in the name of the law, or he should
be under the necessity of calling in military aid to enforce his mission.
Upon this they all retired about a mile further, when the cavalry disappearing
they formed another ring.” The name of this magisterial specimen of
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">suaviter in modo et fortiter re</span></i> has not been recorded by the admiring
reporter, or we would willingly have perpetuated it. Mr. Coady was now
called to appear and face his man; but in the interval his eyes had nearly
closed. “He <em>refused to enter the ring</em>,” says the report, “<em>so the battle was
declared a drawn one</em>.”<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c009'><sup>[112]</sup></a> That there was no further interruption is shown
by the fact that there was a third battle, between O’Donnell and Smith.
(See <span class='sc'>O’Donnell</span> in Appendix.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Maddox once more retired to his vocation as a street dealer in fish, fruit,
flowers, and other commodities then generally hawked through the scattered
suburbs, now solidified into the enormous mass of the mighty metropolis—in
plain prose, he followed his vocation of a costermonger, and was a noted
character among the Westminster fraternity. Meantime, Bill Richmond, his
old antagonist, had won himself a name and position among the list of boxers,
and the blot on his ’scutcheon, from his early and summary defeat by Maddox,
so sorely troubled him that he longed to rub it out by another tourney. He
challenged the veteran, who accepted the defiance. They met August 9,
1809. John Gully seconded the veteran, and Bill Gibbons, his Westminster
“pal,” was his bottle-holder. Yet one more illustration of the soundness of
Captain Godfrey’s axiom, not to “trust battle to a waning age,” was given.
Maddox in his fifty-fourth year, after fifty-two rounds, reluctantly gave in
to his younger, heavier, and stronger adversary.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all the numerous contests in which Maddox had been engaged, his
courage was pre-eminent. As a pugilist, he was conspicuous for determined
rallying and quick hitting; and, though well acquainted with the science,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>he relied more on his true game than strictly following the principles of the
art. It is but justice to his memory to state, according to the best information
upon the subject, that pugilism was never disgraced by any of his public
encounters, nor his character ever stained by making a cross.</p>

<p class='c007'>A short time previous to his death a benefit was got up for “the veteran”
at the One Tun Room, Jermyn Street, which was well attended, and at which
the first pugilists exhibited specimens of self-defence; among whom several
of his old opponents were not backward in assisting him by their efforts, as
Cribb, Bittoon, O’Donnell, Richmond, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The death of this courageous boxer was the consequence of an accident.
The pipes (in those days hollowed trunks of elm trees) which conveyed water
through the Borough Market were under repair, and the dark street “for in
those days we had not got to gas,” left with a yawning chasm. Into one of
these, while repairing to market before dawn, poor George was precipitated;
he received a compound fracture of the thigh, erysipelas supervened, and our
hero, for hero he was though humble, closed his career in St. Thomas’s
Hospital. George was buried, by the subscriptions of some of his brother
boxers in the churchyard of St. George the Martyr.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>CALEB BALDWIN, “THE PRIDE OF WESTMINSTER.”—1786 (1792)‒1816.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Caleb Stephen Ramsbottom, for such were the registered sponsorial and
patronymic styles of this well-known boxer, was born beneath the shadow of
the venerable abbey church of St. Peter’s, Westminster, in what were the
head-quarters of the costermongery of western London, in the early days
of the third George, to wit, the 22nd of April, 1769. We like to be
particular in the birthdays of remarkable men, for Caleb, in his day, was
a more noted character, and certainly more of an “original,” than many
upon whom biographers have wasted mutton fat, or, more classically, “the
midnight oil.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader will best form a judgment of Caleb’s qualities as a “good piece
of stuff,” from an unvarnished account of his performances within the ropes.
We may premise, however, that Caleb in his later days weighed but
9st. 11lbs., and therefore may well take his own assertion, that he was
quite four pounds less when in his younger days he met antagonists, without
much distinction of age or height; his own being five feet seven inches.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall pass Caleb’s youthful skirmishes with unknown antagonists,
referring the curious to “Boxiana,” vol. i., pp. 301‒307. The first of these,
we are told, was with “one Gregory,” in 1786, and then follow flourishing
accounts of victories over Jem Jones, Arthur Smith, Jerry Matthews, Bill
Berks, Wadham (a grenadier), Kelly, “one Jones,” a fourteen stone coal-whipper,
Bob Parker, etc., etc., all of which “the historian,” fancifully
embellishes with such characteristic touches as would induce us to think that
he had himself been eye witness and reporter of the frays.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1792, on the 14th of May, we find Caleb’s first recorded battle. It was
with the well-known Tom (Paddington) Jones, at Hurley Bottom, after the
fight between Mendoza and Bill Warr. They fought for a purse of £20,
but after a game and even contest of half an hour, a dispute arose, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>battle was declared “a draw.” They were each so satisfied with the other’s
goodness, that though they met for many long years afterwards at sparring
benefits, outside the ring as spectators and inside as seconds, they never
again held up naked fists as adversaries.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c009'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>After the great battle between Jem Belcher and Andrew Gamble, December
22, 1800, at Wimbledon Common, a purse of twenty guineas was contended
for. Kelly, a stalwart Irishman, under the patronage of Coady, “the bruising
publican,” and Burke (not Berks), offered himself. The reporter says, “Caleb
Baldwin, a dealer in greens, well-known among the Westminster lads as a
smart customer with the mufflers, accepted the contest. Joe Ward and
Elisha Crabbe, offered themselves as Caleb’s seconds, and Tom Tring was his
bottle-holder. They fought merrily twelve rounds in fifteen minutes, when
Paddy, who could not latterly get in a blow, yielded to a hearty drubbing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In June, 1801, there is proof that Caleb was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">semper paratus</span></i>, like other
heroes. He was enjoying himself at the Pewter Platter, in St. John Street;
Jackling, known as “Ginger,” brother of the renowned Tom Johnson, was
there, and spoke contemptuously of Caleb’s capabilities. A quarrel was the
result, and a challenge following, Caleb turned out there and then. The paragraph
writer says, “Jackling, alias Ginger, Tom Johnson’s brother, having
quarrelled with Caleb Baldwin, they fought a severe battle, in which the
pungency of Ginger was completely overcome by the acrimony of his
antagonist’s fist.”<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c009'><sup>[114]</sup></a> This was thought smart writing in those days.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Jem Belcher, of whom Caleb was always an admiring follower,
had beaten the resolute Joe Berks, at Hurley Bottom, November 25th, 1801,
Lee, “the butcher,”<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c009'><sup>[115]</sup></a> made his appearance, followed by Caleb Baldwin, to
decide their match for twenty guineas a side. Caleb was attended by
Paddington Jones, his old opponent, and Joe Ward; Lee by Maddox and
Seabrook. We preserve the report.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>There was no time lost in setting-to, and
for the first twelve rounds much science was
displayed by the lighter combatant, “the
Westminster Champion,” as he is now styled.
He did not, however, much reduce Lee’s
strength, who fought with determined resolution.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Caleb put in two straight hits through
Lee’s guard; the second brought down the
butcher.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Lee rallied manfully. He got in the
first blow; but Caleb stepped in, put on the
lock, and threw him neatly. (Great shouting
from the “Neddy” drivers.)</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>15.—Caleb gave his adversary a clean
cross buttock.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Lee had the advantage in hitting;
he struck his opponent three severe blows,
and brought him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—In this round Caleb displayed most
excellent skill, strength, and activity. At
the commencement six hard blows were
struck, after which Caleb, fastening on his
antagonist, threw him completely over his
head. Lee’s back rebounded from the stage
with great violence, and he lay panting on
the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Caleb slipped and fell, upon the system
of husbanding his strength.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Caleb gave his antagonist a heavy
knock-down blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Lee fought this round with determined
courage and great skill, but still
Caleb had the best of it.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Caleb gave another knock-down blow,
and Lee, who was completely exhausted,
gave in.</p>

<p class='c022'>The contest lasted twenty-three minutes,
and afforded more amusement and a greater
display of science than even the preceding
grand affair between Belcher and Berks.</p>

<p class='c022'>Lord Say and Sele, The Hon. Berkeley
Craven, Sir Thomas Apreece, Colonel Montgomery,
Captain Taylor, and many other
distinguished amateurs were present.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack O’Donnell having beaten Pardo Wilson (Belcher’s brother-in-law),
and Smith, was now the recognised “Irish champion,” and he challenged
Caleb for fifty guineas a-side, who, nothing loth, entered into articles of
agreement. As there was great apprehension that the Bow Street authorities
would interfere, the matter was “kept dark,” and on Friday morning,
October 21st, 1803, the men and their friends started early by different
roads out of town. Wimbledon Common, in the vicinity of that interesting
landmark of civilisation,<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c009'><sup>[116]</sup></a> the gibbet of the notorious Jerry Abershaw, was
the rendezvous, and there at twelve o’clock all had arrived. Vehicles of
every description and thousands of spectators and equestrians thronged the
valley, a ring was quickly formed, and at half-past twelve O’Donnell entered,
followed by the veteran Caleb. The men immediately threw themselves in
attitude. Odds six to four on Baldwin, readily taken.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—O’Donnell put in the first blow
in his adversary’s side. Caleb returned
dexterously right and left, then closing,
threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—O’Donnell fought very shy, but Caleb
stood to his man, followed him round the
ring, and put in several severe blows, which
were well parried by his adversary. It was
here thought O’Donnell was endeavouring to
wind Caleb; however, he did not fall off in
putting in his blows, and having got O’Donnell
to the edge of the ring, put in a most
severe body hit, which brought him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—At the commencement of this round
O’Donnell appeared sick from the effects of
the last blow, which Caleb perceiving, stuck
to him closely, not allowing him even time
for breath. O’Donnell tried to avoid him,
but failed. They closed, and Caleb again
threw him. (Odds had now risen as high as
four to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—This round was well contested by both
combatants. O’Donnell recovered, came up
in better spirits, and fought more manfully.
He put in several good blows, and cut his
opponent over the right eye; they closed,
and O’Donnell for the first time threw Caleb.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The sun now was extremely troublesome,
particularly to O’Donnell, who shifted
and tried hard to get the shady side; but
Caleb’s cleverness was not to be out done.
Some severe straight-forward blows were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>given on both sides; O’Donnell’s last bringing
his opponent down a second time. His
friends now again began to hope for success,
and odds triflingly changed.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—O’Donnell came up smiling; Caleb
made several blows tell. A blow from
O’Donnell made him stagger, on which he
rushed in, and with great force knocked
down O’Donnell.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—This, although not the last, was the
decisive round. O’Donnell set-to with great
spirits, and displayed great courage and excellent
science. Caleb made several feints,
which by many were considered weakness,
and the odds fell back to even betting.
Caleb, however, caught his opponent off his
guard, and planted a most severe blow in
his kidneys,<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c009'><sup>[117]</sup></a> which had a most visible effect.
They dosed, and O’Donnell was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The effects of the blow, so powerfully
put in by Caleb in the last round, were so
great, that O’Donnell was scarcely able to
stand. Caleb showed as much fight as ever,
followed him up, put in several good blows,
and concluded both the round and the battle
by giving his opponent a violent cross buttock.</p>

<p class='c022'>O’Donnell was immediately led off the
ground greatly distressed, both by the kidney
blow and the last fall; he was placed in
a hackney coach, but his friends neglected
him even more than Berks’ did; they left
him there without any assistance for nearly
two hours, while Caleb was carried in triumph
round the ground, and also until the
termination of another battle, which consisted
of forty rounds.</p>

<p class='c022'>This match was considered extremely
even as to the skill and strength of the combatants.
Both had fought numerous minor
battles, and two or three regular ring-fights,
in which neither of them had been beaten.
Caleb being some years older than his opponent,
O’Donnell’s youth was considered to
be an equivalent for Caleb’s more practical
science.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fight above alluded to was between one Beckley, known as “Blue
Breeches,” and Clarke, which ended in a draw after fifty minutes’ desperate
milling.</p>

<p class='c007'>In November of the same year, O’Donnell again challenged Caleb for
100 guineas. His friends declared the last fight a mistake, the next they
said would be “the real thing.” This, however, came to nothing, and
Caleb, who had long wished to try his skill with the Jewish phenomenon,
Dutch Sam, was backed by his friends, for fifty guineas; and Tuesday,
August 7th, 1804, fixed for the combat, which took place at Wood Green,
near Hornsey. (See Life of <span class='sc'>Dutch Sam</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, Chapter V.)</p>

<p class='c007'>This first defeat of Caleb was by no means a dishonourable one, and when
in the October following a second match was made, Sam, to the surprise of
the amateurs, declined to go on with it, and forfeited his deposit. Caleb’s
friends maintained that he was out of condition on the first occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Tuesday, August 6th, 1805, the long expected battle between Bill
Ryan and Caleb Baldwin crowded the Lewisham side of Blackheath with
thousands of eager spectators. The seat of combat was not determined until
very late on the Monday night, and many who expected it to be at Wilsden
Green, travelled there only to be disappointed. A ring having been formed,
about eleven o’clock the combatants entered, Ryan attended by Tom Jones
and Puss, and Caleb by Pearce, the Game Chicken, and Mountain. Odds
were rather in favour of Caleb, but in general betting was even. After the
usual ceremony they set-to.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Much sparring; Caleb at last
put in two good blows right and left. They
closed, and both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Caleb made a hit, and while closing,
Ryan threw in a severe blow, and cut his
opponent in the face; closed, and both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Caleb threw in some tolerably clean
body blows. Ryan ran in and threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Caleb put in a blow over Ryan’s eye;
it soon swelled and became black. Caleb
terminated the round by giving Ryan a complete
somersault. The advantage was all
with Baldwin.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—A good round. Caleb held his lead
by several sharp blows. They closed, and
after a sharp struggle Caleb was uppermost.
(Shouts for Westminster.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Every move in favour of Caleb, who
was the quicker and more resolute fighter.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Caleb slipped in, hit, and slipped out
again. Ryan followed him, when Caleb hit
up, closed, and threw him another swinging
fall.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Slow sparring. Both blowing, and
Ryan very shy of his man. Caleb put in a
tremendous blow upon his opponent’s head,
and brought him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Caleb with great dexterity repeated
his blow, and Ryan fell again. (Odds were
now five to one in favour of Caleb.)</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Ryan very shy. He, however, rallied,
and threw in several very good hits. Caleb
now began to show exhaustion, as was somewhat
expected from his violent exertion.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Ryan began to show to advantage.
Caleb was fatigued, and Ryan’s superior
strength appeared manifest.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Every round now added fresh superiority
to Ryan, who, although much
fatigued, threw his opponent every time.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—This was the last round in which
there was any fighting. Caleb summoned
all his courage, put in some well-aimed
blows, but was too weak to withstand his
opponent, who again brought him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—Caleb fell, almost exhausted, and
while falling Ryan hit him. The ring was
instantly broken in, and a cry of “Foul”
raised. It was clearly a mere dodge to save
the stakes. But while the connoisseurs were
debating the question, a party of dragoons
arrived and dispersed the assemblage. The
combatants, both pretty well thrashed, were
put together in a postchaise and brought to
London. The fight had lasted half an hour,
when this wrangle took place.</p>

<p class='c013'>At a subsequent meeting it was agreed that the military interference made
it a drawn battle. Ryan declined a renewal of the match.</p>

<p class='c007'>This may be considered the legitimate wind-up of Caleb’s professional
career as a pugilist, after twenty years of ring practice (1786‒1806), with one
solitary defeat, and that at the hands of the renowned Dutch Sam. From
this time Caleb figures as one of the most active and interesting characters in
“the Fancy,” and the liveliest leader and councillor of the followers of the
ring. For years he was in his sphere a sort of pugilistic Palmerston in the
Westminster purlieus of Downing Street. His courage was never doubted;
his science was unquestionable; his honesty never impeached, and his fun
was perennial. Caleb, though never quarrelsome, was always ready upon
warrantable occasion to “sport his canvas.” Few harder hitters were to
be found, and many first-rate pupils were turned out by him. In his own
dominion, on the downs of Tothill, his opinions upon sporting matters commanded
deference, and Caleb’s judgment in matters concerning man, dog,
badger, or bull, was almost without appeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>In May, 1816, a curious day’s “outing” took place, to witness a battle
between a couple of “darkies,” hight Stephenson<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c009'><sup>[118]</sup></a> and Sam Robinson;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“Ethiopian” bruisers, like Ethiopian serenaders, being now in fashion,
from the exploits of such men as Richmond, Kendrick, and Co. To Coombe
Warren, also, one Bristow, known as “Young Massa,” in the service of a
sporting gentleman, had repaired. Caleb as one of the M.C.’s was beating
out the ring, when he applied the thong to Young Massa, who, new to his
freedom and unacquainted with the person and privileges of Caleb as a public
functionary, retorted by a couple of such unexpected facers as drew “the
veteran’s” cork. A row was the immediate consequence, in which Caleb
proposed to cast the question of his ring privilege to the winds, and then and
there vindicate his insulted manhood. He was at length indulged. The two
principals actually quitted the ropes and Caleb was “indulged” with “a
round or two,” as he expressed it. Bill Richmond hereon offered to pick up
Bristow, and Harry Harmer valeted the Veteran. The affair showed that
Young Massa was not to be easily disposed of. The report is Pierce Egan’s,
though it is not even alluded to in his life of Caleb Baldwin.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Caleb seemed angry, and eager
to check this daring novice for his presumption,
set-to with great courage, and wished
to mill off hand this sprig of colour, but
Massa laughed at the attempt, returned hit
for hit, and in closing brought the veteran
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Young Massa not only showed pluck,
but his attitudes were imposing, and the
champion of Westminster did not know what
to make of him. Caleb hit out viciously,
which the black returned on the nob of his
opponent, and the veteran, in a close, went
down undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—On setting-to Massa put in a severe
facer, and followed it up so strongly, that
the champion was fairly hit down.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Young Blacky, full of gaiety, pointed
his finger at the veteran, by way of derision,
and kept moving with great agility that he
might not be smashed by the superior
science he had to contend against. Some
blows were exchanged, and, in closing, this
game sprig fibbed Caleb severely, and
brought him again down undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The youth of the Black encouraged
him to proceed, and he hit out rather in a
scientific style, as if he had taken lessons.
Caleb seemed not able to stop him, and the
veteran’s sight appeared somewhat defective,
as he generally hit short. In closing, as
before, the Black fibbed away, and Caleb
went down undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Caleb, on his guard, had the best of
this round, and, in closing, turned the novice
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Young Massa seemed an apt scholar,
quite on the alert, and, under the guidance
of such a second as Richmond he stood
more than a chance to do something. He
put in three severe hits, got away cleverly,
and succeeded finally in bringing down his
man.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Caleb’s nob was properly crimsoned,
and in every round he received more than
he gave. His once acknowledged talent for
serving out appeared to be gone by, or else
this almost conqueror of Dutch Sam could
never have suffered so many rounds to have
passed over to his evident disadvantage.
The young Black had too much gaiety for
him, and he threw the champion against his
will.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Caleb got a little into work, and gave
Massa a small taste; but he seemed to make
no impression; however, he ultimately
brought the young one down.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—This was a sort of scuffling round,
but Caleb had the best of the throw.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Blacky ran in with great velocity,
and gave his opponent a tremendous body
blow—a perfect winder! It was heard at
some distance, and the champion felt not a
little surprised. In closing, they both went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Appearances were most certainly
against Caleb; but yet some trifling odds
were betted, from what he had formerly
done, that the old trump would be able to
come through the piece. At Caleb’s age,
the Black must have been considered a dangerous
unlucky customer to have fallen in
his way, so unprepared as he then was. It
was altogether an unfortunate turn up for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>the veteran; and even the terrors of the
ring did not in the least abate the confidence
of the young adventurer, who hit out and
faced his man more like an experienced
boxer than a raw chance miller. Caleb
again found himself on the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>13 and last.—Caleb, full of pluck, seemed
to rally all his capabilities into action, and
rushed toward the scratch with all the
eagerness of a Richard, mentally exclaiming—“Perish
the thought; ne’er be it said that
Caleb, the renowned Caleb Baldwin, of milling
notoriety, ever surrendered his hard-earned
laurels into the hands of a mere
strippling novice, and that too a Black!”
The champion put in some of his teasers,
and, it is but justice to observe, that the
young one was not a jot behind hand in
returning some good hits. It was a milling
round altogether, but, in closing, Caleb was
again down. Some interference now appeared
to be made, and the darling fame of
Caleb was rescued from the tottering brink
of destruction by Blacky giving in, to the
great astonishment and surprise of the spectators,
as the young one had only a very
slight scratch over one of his eyes. Caleb
was thus enabled once more to return to his
dominions as the conquering hero. Young
Blacky, upon being persuaded to relinquish
the contest, received the sum of 30<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i>, collected
by subscription, as a reward for the
pluck he manifested in daring to enter the
lists with so renowned a punisher as Caleb
Ramsbottom Baldwin.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c009'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Caleb henceforth wisely confined himself to seconding and ring-keeping,
in which his services were conspicuous and constant. On May 15, 1817,
we find a joint benefit announced for two veterans, Caleb Baldwin and “Old
Joe Ward,” now in his seventy-second year. Cribb and Tom Oliver sparred
on this occasion. The wind-up was between Caleb and Paddington Jones.
“The first-named old trump prefaced his set-to by informing the company
that twenty-eight years ago he and his friend Jones fought a tough fight
together and had been ‘pals’ ever since. (Applause.) Caleb still retains
considerable energy, and the display of the ‘old school’ was very creditable.
Two sons of Caleb also exhibited their skill with the gloves, the second with
young Perry, who ‘bested’ him. Caleb’s first-born set-to with Jack Martin,
but his pipes were out of order and he took off the gloves as quickly as he
well could. They will not continue the renown of the father’s name.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We find Caleb’s name in numerous benefits for his brother pugilists, and in
1819 (Sept. 16), he advertised a benefit at the “Minor Theatre in the
Strand.” As these announcements occasionally possess a curiosity from their
scarcity, we subjoin one of Caleb’s as a specimen:—</p>

receive a High Treat.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Cognoscenti, the Lads of the Turf, and the Fancy in general, cannot obliterate from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>memory the amusement they have enjoyed from the able, spirited, and active manner in
which Caleb always kept the Ring for them on Days of Sport; nor can it be forgotten, he
has fought upwards of Thirty Battles, and was never beat, previous to that unsuccessful
set-to with Dutch Sam.</p>

<p class='c018'>This true-bottomed Champion of his day once moved in comfort and prosperity; and we
have to deplore that the case is now altered. We trust a Real-bred Sportsman will never see
a Worthy Veteran of the Turf in Distress, and shut up that spirit which should distinguish
such a character. The single reflection of</p>

<p class='c013'>On the 8th November, 1827, the veteran Caleb received his last “warning
to quit,” and shuffled off this mortal coil, in the spot of his nativity, and
many an “old one” recounted his early deeds, with disparaging reflections
(not always deserved) on the young ’uns who were likely to succeed him.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>APPENDIX TO PERIOD III.</h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c016'>ANDREW GAMBLE—1792‒1800.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Andrew Gamble, another of Pierce Egan’s Irish “champions,” appears
to have been a powerful, game, hard-hitting, clumsy, knock-kneed Hibernian,
of six feet in stature, and a strong fighting instinct. His eulogium may be
read in “Boxiana,” vol. i., pp. 239 et seq. We here give what we can find
in the contemporary prints.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Andrew Gamble,” says “Pancratia,” (p. 132), “was born in Dublin
in 1771, apprenticed to a stonemason, and early displayed a propensity for
the pugilistic art. He is about six feet in height and has contested many
battles, particularly those with Stanyard in 1792;<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c009'><sup>[121]</sup></a> with Jones, in 1800;
and with Jem Belcher.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gamble’s first appearance in the English ring was on the 5th September,
1792, at Bentley Green, nine miles from Colchester, which is thus recorded:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This day (Friday, September 5), Hooper, the tinman (See <span class='sc'>Hooper</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>),
having beaten Bunner, of Colchester, the day previous, Ben Stanyard, a
pugilist from Birmingham, mounted the stage to box with Andrew Gamble,
an Irishman. Joe Ward seconded Stanyard, and Hooper was his bottle-holder,
looking little worse for his yesterday’s battle. Gamble was seconded
by one Williams, and had Ryan for his bottle-holder. The stage was enlarged
from eighteen to twenty-one feet square. The spot was Bentley Green,
nine miles from Colchester.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At first setting-to odds were greatly in favour of Gamble, till after some
few rounds, when they became even, but Gamble’s superiority gained the
bets in his favour five to four, and they again changed to the same height in
favour of Stanyard, during the last six rounds, who then unfortunately made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>a foul blow at his adversary, which every one considered would have
terminated the battle. Gamble’s friends, however, advising him to continue
the contest, they fought another round, at the end of which Stanyard fell
and Gamble retired, declaring himself victorious. Stanyard remained on the
ground until his friends triumphantly carried him away. The umpires,
seconds, etc., had many meetings, and it was at length declared a drawn
battle. The contest was well supported, the combatants having met
nineteen times in twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To make amends for the disappointment, a bye-battle was fought between
two countrymen, and very well contested.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For eight years we lose sight of Gamble, as a pugilist, until in July, 1800,
we find him matched with Noah James,<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c009'><sup>[122]</sup></a> the guardsman. The battle is thus
reported:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“On Tuesday, July 1 (1800), a boxing match which had long been
expected was fought in a hollow near the foot of Abbershaw’s gibbet, on
Wimbledon Common, for 100 guineas, and bets to the amount of £5000,
between Andrew Gamble the Irish pugilist, and Noah James, formerly
belonging to the horseguards. Ben Stanyard, his old opponent, and now fast
friend, was Gamble’s second, and Jack Bartholomew his bottle-holder; Joe
Ward seconded James, and Hall was his bottle-holder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“About ten o’clock the combatants set-to, when odds were six to four in
favour of James; they fought with astonishing fierceness and displayed great
science. In the twelfth round Gamble put in a severe blow in the face
of his antagonist, and cut his nose dreadfully; in the twentieth he broke his
collar-bone, and in the twenty-first his jaw bone; but notwithstanding such
a dreadful state of disablement, James fought four rounds afterwards with
determined courage, when he fell almost lifeless on the stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“James was a Cheshire man, and had fought seventeen battles. He was
allowed to display more bottom than any other man. After this battle,
being given over by his medical attendants, and considering himself at the
last extremity, he sent for Gamble, and generously exchanged forgiveness with
the successful champion. Gamble, equally open hearted, gave Mrs. James a
very handsome present for the more comfortable support of the unfortunate
bruiser.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was Andrew Gamble’s best fight. His warm-hearted friends, now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>overrating his capabilities, determined to match him with the best English
pugilist of the day, the young Bristol champion, Jem Belcher. December
22nd, 1800, was fixed, and the friends of Gamble, having won the choice
of place, named the old hollow, by Abbershaw’s gibbet, on Wimbledon Common,
as the spot. How triumphantly he was thrashed may be read in the
memoir of Jem Belcher; what disgraceful abuse, and worse, he received at
the hands of “his enraged backers,” may be read in “Boxiana,” p. 242.
We have extracted it as a specimen of “history,” omitting the small capitals,
italics, and emphasised slang.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gamble’s being so soon deprived of his laurels, created the most dreadful
murmurings among his countrymen, many of whom were nearly ruined from
Gamble being defeated. St. Giles’s was in a complete uproar upon this
occasion, and the Paddies had not been so neatly cleaned out since the days of
the renowned hero Peter Corcoran! It proved a most woeful day for the Irish
indeed; the dealers in wild ducks had not a feather left to fly with; the
rabbit merchants were so reduced as to be even without poles, and not a
copper to go the next morning to market; never were men so completely
dished and done up. Andrew’s name had hitherto been a tower of strength,
he was the tight Irish boy, and the darling of his country—but alas! the
scene was changed, he was now called a cur, an overgrown thing, a mere
apology, and was in danger of being tossed in a blanket by his enraged and
disappointed backers. Gamble, from this defeat, lost the warm hearts of the
Paddies ever afterwards. Gamble appeared truly contemptible in this fight,
in comparison with even the worst of his former displays—and it was the
opinion of the amateurs, that the evident superiority of Belcher completely
frightened all Gamble’s courage and science out of him.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic transit gloria</span></i>, etc.; Andrew Gamble appears to have returned to
Ireland, and probably to his laborious calling.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>JACK BARTHOLOMEW—1795‒1800.</h4>

<p class='c013'>One of the true breed of old-school British boxers was Jack Bartholomew.
His game was undoubted and his style manly. His opponents, too, were the
very best men of their day, and if his career was not a brilliant one, Jack
was always highly esteemed by his backers, and reckoned a formidable
competitor.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Bartholomew was born at Brentford, Middlesex, in 1770, and early convinced
several of the amateurs in that neighbourhood of his gift of hitting,
activity, and courage. Jack Firby, who had earned the unenviable cognomen
of “the Young Ruffian,” from his conquest of Symonds, “the Old Ruffian,”
on the 2nd August, 1791, was picked out as a trial-horse for young Jack, in
the regular P.R. A stake of ten guineas seems to have tempted Firby
to tackle the youngster. The fight came off on Hounslow Heath, near
Bartholomew’s native spot. Firby, who weighed fifteen stone, and stood six
feet, considered the stakes “a gift.” Jack, at this time was nearly twelve
stone, and stood five feet nine inches and a half, a height and weight which
the best authorities have considered “big enough for anything on two legs.”
Firby seems to have considered his fame involved, for he fought with unusual
desperation, but the youth was not to be “ruffianised” out of his skill and
coolness; and after a desperate fight of fifty minutes, in which his firmness
and manly intrepidity were finely contrasted with the opponent’s impetuous
assaults, Firby was beaten blind, and his “gluttony perfectly satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bill Wood, the coachman, then in the height of his fame, was next
matched with Bartholomew. They met on a stage between Ealing and
Harrow, January 30, 1797. Bartholomew had the battle declared against
him for a foul blow. (See <span class='sc'>Wood</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, Appendix to Period II.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Owen’s renown in conquering Hooper, the tinman, induced him to
issue a challenge to Jack; it was accepted, and they met for a stake of fifty
guineas, on Sunbury Common, August 22, 1797. Five and six to four were
the current odds in favour of Owen, who was the bigger and stronger man,
forced the fighting desperately, but he could not break Jack’s guard, and
was so heavily punished that in about half an hour he was all abroad, and at
the end of the twenty-sixth round, fought in thirty minutes, he was compelled
to give in, after a fight of unusual rapidity and punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bartholomew now met a master of the art in the person of Jem Belcher,
with whom he had the honour of fighting a drawn battle, on the 15th August,
1799. His final defeat by the champion, May 15th, 1800, was also without
disgrace. (See memoir of <span class='sc'>Jem Belcher</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>During the period of his active life in the ring, scarcely a battle of note
happened without the name of Bartholomew appearing as second or bottleholder.
Shortly after his last defeat by Belcher, however, Jack seems to
have been attacked by liver disease. He died, after a few weeks’ illness,
at his lodgings in the Almonry, Westminster, July 14, 1803. He left a
particular request that his body might be opened (against which practice an
ignorant prejudice then prevailed). A <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</span></i> examination took place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>and a considerable scirrhous enlargement of the liver was found. He
further requested that his grave should be “as near as possible to St.
Margaret’s watch-house.” His funeral was attended by a considerable
number of his brother pugilists.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>JACK O’DONNELL—1802‒1806.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c009'><sup>[123]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c013'>John O’Donnell, a native of the sister isle, for a short period was much
overrated and unduly puffed by what Pierce Egan calls his “warm-hearted
countrymen.” We know nothing more of him than that shortly after his
appearance in ring circles he was matched with Pardo Wilson, a relative
of the celebrated Belcher’s, on Tuesday, October 26th, 1802. The extravagant
estimate of “the historian” does not seem to have been shared by the
backers and friends of Wilson, as Pardo, whose last and only other fight
fourteen years before, had been with Solly Sodicky, a Jew, on that occasion
suffered defeat (February 11th, 1789). The ground was Wormwood
Scrubbs, on the bank of the Paddington Canal, four miles from Hyde Park.
The stake was twenty guineas aside. We copy the report:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wilson was thirty-five years of age, and O’Donnell, who had the
advantage in height and weight, was said to be only eighteen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“About one o’clock a ring was attempted to be formed, but such numbers
of people had assembled that it was not without the greatest trouble it was
accomplished by two, when the combatants entered. O’Donnell was accompanied
by two of his own countrymen; Wilson, by Belcher, his brother-in-law,
for his second, and Tom Jones bottle-holder. They began to strip
immediately, both appeared in high spirits and eyed each other minutely.
When ready the seconds proposed that they should toss up for the side of the
ring, each being desirous to avoid the sun. This was agreed to, and the
advantage gained by Wilson, in whose favour, on account of his freshness,
bets appeared to be. At five minutes past two o’clock, after the usual
ceremony, the heroes set-to.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Both displayed good attitude,
and kept a strong guard for some time.
O’Donnell put in the first blow, which Wilson
parried and returned. Both fell, O’Donnell
having received a blow on the lip, which
bled a little.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>2.—Wilson made a feint but his opponent
struck him at the same time. A few sharp
blows passed, when O’Donnell gave Wilson
a cross buttock.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—In this round O’Donnell displayed
great strength. Wilson fell back, and with
success chopped at his adversary as he came
up to him. Some hard fighting ensued, and
O’Donnell knocked down his antagonist.
(Bets now changed in favour of the Irishman.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—This round began with some good
straight-forward fighting. O’Donnell aimed
several blows at the body, which Wilson
dexterously stopped and returned. O’Donnell,
however, followed him up until he fell.
Wilson’s strength appeared to be failing.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Wilson seemed afraid of his opponent,
and manœuvred round the ring. O’Donnell,
however, stuck close to him, and put in the
first blow, and Wilson, though apparently
not hurt, fell. (Odds were now three to one
in favour of O’Donnell.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Wilson at the beginning put in a successful
blow at O’Donnell’s head; after
which O’Donnell gave a body blow, and
brought down his adversary. It now appeared
settled, but Wilson’s friends persisted
he had not yet shown any of his best play.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Wilson now tried to alter his mode of
fighting, by allowing O’Donnell to strike,
stopping the blow, and returning it with the
same arm; but in this he failed, his returns
not being successful. O’Donnell followed
up, and again brought down his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Immediately they were up, they set-to
with great eagerness, and displayed some
excellent straight-forward fighting. Wilson
appeared to recruit his strength, but it soon
failed again, and he fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—O’Donnell struck his adversary on the
temple; Wilson reeled, and receiving another
blow, fell again.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—This was a very short round, Wilson
received a violent blow on the ribs, reeled,
and fell against the people, when Belcher
advised him to give in, to which he consented.</p>

<p class='c022'>O’Donnell being declared the conqueror,
his countrymen, of whom there were numbers
present, mounted him on their shoulders,
and carried him out in triumph.</p>

<p class='c013'>We think the reader will agree that there is nothing in this victory over
an old stale man to call for the epithets of “eminent,” “distinguished,”
etc., used in “Boxiana,” nor that the Irishman, should “be so raised in the
eyes of his countrymen as their future champion, reminding them of those
proud days when Peter Corcoran flourished in all his greatness!” But let
that pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Monday, November 15th, 1802, a match having been made between
O’Donnell, and one Smith, a boot closer, they met at Wormwood Scrubbs,
to decide the contest, for twenty guineas. Lenox seconded O’Donnell, and
one Anderson picked up Smith.</p>

<p class='c007'>After some trouble, and by the aid of Caleb Baldwin, who had recently
beaten Jack Lee, at Hurley Bottom, a ring was formed, the combatants
entered, and five minutes after two o’clock set-to.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Much sparring. O’Donnell put
in the first blow, a straight-forward hit with
his right hand, and struck his adversary
under the left eye. Smith aimed a blow at
his opponent’s head, which O’Donnell caught
with his hand, and returned it with a blow
on the side of the head. They closed and
fell, O’Donnell having the advantage, being
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Much sparring. Smith put in two
body blows, but slight; they closed and fell.
Smith under again.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Smith gave his antagonist a severe
knock-down blow, by which he fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Both shifted. O’Donnell displayed
good science. When retreating, and followed
up by Smith, he put in several well
planted body blows, and brought Smith
down; but in falling, Smith struck a tremendous
blow in the face of his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Smith struck O’Donnell on the jaw.
The round was well contested, several severe
blows being exchanged, by one of which
O’Donnell fell.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>6.—Smith being off his guard, O’Donnell
put in a severe right-handed blow on the
head, but Smith quickly recovered; they
closed and fell. O’Donnell beginning to
appear weak, odds were five to four in
Smith’s favour.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—This was a hard round. Smith threw
in three uncommonly clean blows; O’Donnell
closed, and both fell, Smith under.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—A great deal of hard fighting, but
O’Donnell shifted. They closed and fell,
O’Donnell under. (Bets still remained five
to four on Smith.)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—O’Donnell had the best of this round,
put in most blows. Smith, in striking,
slipped and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—O’Donnell seemed endeavouring to
rally his courage and irritate his adversary,
by pointing and smiling; Smith, however,
put in some severe blows. They closed, fell,
and O’Donnell was again under. (Bets now
rose two to one in favour of Smith.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—It was some time before any blows
were struck, both shifting. They closed,
and O’Donnell gave his antagonist a cross
buttock, something in the Belcher style.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—O’Donnell evidently mended; both
fought well. They closed, and Smith fell
under. (Odds still were six to four in
favour of Smith.)</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Smith threw in two severe blows
with great dexterity, one in the face and the
other in the pit of the stomach, by which
O’Donnell fell; while going, Smith tried to
give him a cross buttock, but failed.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Both put in some hard blows, but
O’Donnell had the advantage. Smith fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—In O’Donnell’s favour.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Both shifted; much sparring. Smith
fell, but still had the best of the round.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Smith, in retreating, fell; no blows
struck.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—This round was very short, but in
favour of O’Donnell. Smith fell by a blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—After a few tolerably hard blows
were exchanged, Smith struck O’Donnell
with great force on the left side of the head;
they then closed, and Smith fell under.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—At the end of this round Smith had
a tremendous fall; O’Donnell also fell on
him with great violence.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Both fought hard, but O’Donnell
brought down his adversary. (Bets now
became even.)</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—O’Donnell put in a severe blow on
the side of the head; Smith slipped and fell.
After fighting these twenty-two rounds,
neither displayed much external injury, excepting
the black eye Smith got in the first
round. (This does not say much for either
of the men’s gift of hitting.)</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—After much sparring and shifting
O’Donnell brought his opponent down. (Odds
had now changed in favour of O’Donnell.)</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Smith had the best of this round.
After several hard blows had been exchanged,
O’Donnell, in making a hit, slipped,
fell forwards, and pitched upon his head.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—In this round O’Donnell displayed
great activity, and by a well-directed blow
brought down his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—Smith put in some good body blows,
and O’Donnell fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—In this round the greatest science
was displayed by both parties. Some blows
were well struck, in which Smith had the
advantage. They closed and fell, Smith
under.</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—This round was equal, if not superior,
to the last in scientific display. Smith aimed
all his blows at the head, and O’Donnell at
the body, by which Smith had the advantage.
They closed and fell, Smith being
under again.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—Here O’Donnell manifestly obtained
great advantage; Smith fell. (Odds now
rose five to four in favour of O’Donnell.)</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—In this round O’Donnell showed still
greater superiority. He put in several very
severe blows about the ribs, and as his antagonist
was retreating, he struck him in the
face and brought him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>34 to 37.—In every round Smith fell.
(Odds rose six to four on O’Donnell.)</p>

<p class='c022'>38.—O’Donnell struck Smith in the pit
of the stomach, and he fell. This blow
thoroughly winded him, and it was supposed
the battle would have been finished; but
Smith by his proper time came up again.</p>

<p class='c022'>39 to 43.—All these rounds were very
short, and O’Donnell evidently had the advantage.</p>

<p class='c022'>44.—O’Donnell, from having continually
throughout the combat used his right hand,
had severely strained it, and it was expected
that this circumstance would have obliged
him to give in, but dexterously putting in a
blow with the left hand, he brought down
his adversary.</p>

<p class='c022'>45.—O’Donnell in this round repeated his
winding dose in the stomach, which undoubtedly
decided the battle, for Smith
never afterwards struck any blow of consequence.</p>

<p class='c022'>The 48th round decided the contest in
favour of the Hibernian, Smith being almost
too much exhausted to support his guard.
O’Donnell by a dreadful blow brought him
down, when he immediately gave in, after a
contest of one hour and twenty minutes.
O’Donnell throughout the battle had constantly
struck his antagonist on the left ribs,
which part, when the battle ceased, was
greatly swelled and bruised.</p>

<p class='c022'>Coady, Gamble, Berks, Belcher, Wood,
and many professors of the art were present.
O’Donnell’s countrymen carried him home
in triumph, exulting in his glory.</p>

<p class='c013'>O’Donnell’s game, if not his skill, or his capabilities for punishing, was
fully established by this encounter, and he was backed to fight one Henigan.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>The miscarriage of this event may be read in the subjoined paragraph:—“Tuesday,
the 18th of January, 1803, was the day determined upon for the
decision of a pugilistic contest between O’Donnell, who was now considered
by the Irish as their champion, and the restorer of their fame in the noble
science of pugilism, and one Henigan, a new candidate of bruising celebrity,
brought forward and matched by Jackling, the brother-in-law of the well-known
and lamented Tom Johnson. On the night before, however, both these heroes,
notwithstanding they each boasted strength in the fore paw, felt somewhat
confused by a visit from Armstrong, who without much ceremony conveyed
them to Worship Street, and bound them in sureties of £400 to keep the
peace for six months. O’Donnell on hearing this considered the fight at an
end, but Henigan fearing lest such a restriction might blast his rising genius,
determined to run all risks, and accordingly repaired to Dulwich, the
appointed Campus Martius. His opponent, however, was not there, and
the travellers returned with great chagrin depicted in their countenances.”</p>

<p class='c007'>O’Donnell’s next opponent was the well-known Caleb Baldwin; but here
his friends had made a mistake. He was polished off triumphantly (October
13th, 1803), by the Westminster hero. (See <span class='sc'>Caleb Baldwin</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 213.)
Pierce Egan thus pathetically records this defeat:—“<span class='sc'>O’Donnell</span> was
matched against <em>Caleb Baldwin</em>, but being defeated—<span class='fss'>MARK THE DIFFERENCE</span>!!!—<em>No
smiles! no shouts! no shoulders offered to support the drooping
hero!</em> but he was placed in a hackney coach, to groan and reflect upon the
reverse of fortune! Any further comment is unnecessary!!!” With this we
fully agree. Where were the “warm-hearted countrymen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>O’Donnell having some altercation at Belcher’s about his defeat of Pardo
Wilson, a challenge was the result. On this occasion O’Donnell, who is styled
by Pierce “the celebrated Irish hero,” embraced the opportunity of meeting
Tom for a subscription purse of twenty guineas, at Shepperton, Surrey,
April 17, 1805, when he was thoroughly thrashed in fifteen rounds.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c009'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A big fellow of the name of Emery, who, we learn incidentally, had on a
former occasion beaten O’Donnell, was challenged by him for fifty guineas,
and the challenge accepted. We copy the report:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“On Tuesday, December 3rd (1805), a battle was fought in the Five
Fields, Chelsea, between O’Donnell, the Irish bruiser, and a man of the
name of Emery, for a subscription purse. The combatants had some time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>since quarrelled, when Emery being the bigger man, and O’Donnell out
of health, he had an easy conquest, but the result of this battle proved a
salutary warning to those who under the conceit of superior strength presume
to try conclusions against practised skill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A ring having been formed at two o’clock, the combatants entered;
Tom Blake (Tom Tough), and Bill Ryan seconded O’Donnell; Emery was
handled by Paddington Jones and Wight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On stripping Emery showed such astonishing muscle that he appeared
capable of seizing his opponent in his arms and carrying him off. He was
not only much taller, but two stone heavier than O’Donnell, and among the
crowd two to one was betted in his favour, despite a partisanship for the
lesser man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At setting-to Emery showed great confidence, and stood up in good
style. O’Donnell making a feint with his left hand, put in a severe blow
with his right on the mouth; they closed, and both fell. O’Donnell in this
round displayed all the advantage arising from skill; this he supported, and
at the end of five rounds bets became even. In the ninth round Emery
exerted his greatest powers, and some good blows were exchanged, but
O’Donnell hitting right and left, brought him down. Odds two to one in
favour of O’Donnell. The eleventh round Emery made a false hit, and
completely ran from his man, and in the following round fell without a
blow. O’Donnell continued to support a decided superiority, and at the
end of three quarters of an hour Emery resigned the contest, carrying with
him marks sufficient to deter him from again attempting to meet a professional
boxer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>O’Donnell, taught by experience, did not fly at the highest game, and
avoided Dutch Sam and such professionals of the first rank. An aspirant
of the name of Wasdell, a weaver from Spitalfields, having acquired great
renown among the East Enders, his friends offered to back him for twenty
guineas a-side against O’Donnell. This was arranged, and Tuesday, June 3rd,
1806, and Wilsden Green, near Hendon, named as the day and place. At
twelve the combatants entered the ring; O’Donnell was seconded by John
Gully and Bill Ryan; Wasdell by Rhodes and his brother. Seven to four on
O’Donnell.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Much sparring. Wasdell extremely
awkward, hit short twice; in recovering
his position, O’Donnell caught him
in the body and knocked him down cleverly.
(Three to one on O’Donnell.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Wasdell made play pluckily, but
O’Donnell met him and dropped him again.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Wasdell already was marked about
the head. He made a plunging hit, but
O’Donnell parried it, feinted, followed him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>and hit him completely off his legs, when he
set very quietly on his nether end on the
grass for a few seconds, till taken to his
corner.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Wasdell tried to catch hold of his
opponent with his right hand. O’Donnell
dropped in two sharp hits, the left at the
head, the right at the body, which brought
him to grief again.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The men closed. O’Donnell hit up in
Wasdell’s face, and he was down again.
(Any odds on O’Donnell.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Wasdell, game, rushed in furiously,
receiving a severe hit in the face, through
his guard. The round ended by O’Donnell
hitting him off his legs.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—O’Donnell well on the body. The
men closed, but broke away. Wasdell made
another attempt to seize his opponent’s hand,
but O’Donnell frustrated his endeavour by a
severe blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Wasdell was quite done over. O’Donnell
fought him as he liked, showing great
good humour. He forbore hitting him hard,
and pushed him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Wasdell would not be denied; he
rushed in, when O’Donnell hit him severely
right and left in the face, and he fell stupefied.
On coming to, he acknowledged
O’Donnell to be the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c022'>In weight and length of arm Wasdell had
the advantage, but in science he was the
merest novice, totally ignorant of the art of
boxing, and scarcely as clever as may often
be seen in a street fight.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the 5th of June, only two days after the above battle, there was a
grand field day at Padnall Corner, on Epping Forest, wherein Jack Warr
and Quirk, for 100 guineas, and George Maddox and Coady having exhibited
their skill, Smith and O’Donnell entered the ropes for forty guineas a-side.
Of this the reporter simply says: “The third contest between Smith and
O’Donnell was utterly unworthy of detail. O’Donnell proved the victor in
five rounds.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As upon principle throughout these biographies we have avoided the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">suggestio falsi</span></i> so shall we eschew the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">suppressio veri</span></i>. Jack O’Donnell is one
of the warning examples of the effects of dishonest companions. He became
connected with a gang of known “putters-up” of robberies; among them
two men named Samuel Carter and John Jose. With these men he was
apprehended for stealing from a public house kept by Jonathan Kendall,
bank notes to the amount of £60. At the September Old Bailey Sessions,
1806, the three were found guilty of stealing, but “not in the dwelling
house.” The offence, however, was then capital, the amount being above
forty shillings, and they were sentenced to transportation for life. Berks
and another of the gang, James Travers, who appears to have been Joe’s
tempter, were convicted at the same sessions. (See <span class='sc'>Berks</span>.)</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BILL RYAN (SON OF MICHAEL RYAN, THE OPPONENT OF TOM JOHNSON)—1804‒1806.</h4>

<p class='c013'>This boxer had a short career, for a reason that will fully develope itself
in the next few paragraphs. He was the son of the “renowned first champion
of the same name.” Pierce Egan also informs us that Bill was “a much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>superior fighter to his veteran sire,” which is an opinion worth as much as
you please, recollecting that Pierce was then placing his legs under Tom
Belcher’s mahogany, and Tom had been beaten by Young Ryan. As the
“historian” dismisses him in half a page of large print, we will preserve
what we find of him in contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On Friday, November 30, 1804, Tom Belcher, brother of the nonpareil
Jem, met Bill Ryan, son of Michael Ryan who fought Johnson, at Wilsden
Green, which has become a favourite spot for these encounters. By the
articles, Monday was fixed, but a difficulty having arisen, it was postponed.
At ten o’clock the combatants having arrived a ring was formed. Belcher
first, in high spirits, threw his hat into the ropes in defiance. Ryan smiled
at Tom’s style of bravado, and bowing to some bystanding patrons, got
within the enclosure. Belcher was attended by George Maddox and Joe
Norton, and Ryan seconded by Tom Jones and Dick Whale. In a few
minutes they set-to. Odds six to four in favour of Belcher.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—No sparring. Several good hits
put in and well stopped on both sides; they
closed, and both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>3 and 4.—Both rounds greatly in favour of
Ryan.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—This round was fought with determined
courage. Belcher threw in a severe
blow on his opponent’s temple, and brought
him down. Ryan appeared a little distressed.
(Seven to four on Belcher.)</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—No great alteration up to this round,
which was admirably contested on both
sides. Belcher struck his opponent very
cleverly over the mouth. Ryan rallied,
and put in a knock-down blow; Belcher
fell and evinced great weakness. From
this to the</p>

<p class='c022'>30th—Ryan supported his superiority, and
the odds changed in his favour. Belcher’s
friends now began greatly to despair of success,
but still he displayed great science and
steadiness.</p>

<p class='c022'>31‒34.—Every one of these rounds Ryan
terminated by knocking down his opponent(?)</p>

<p class='c022'>35.—James Belcher came and whispered
to his brother, who seemed to profit by his
advice, and contested the two following
rounds with great skill and determination,
but at the end of the</p>

<p class='c022'>37th—He fell quite exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>38.—Belcher was, however, brought up to
stand another round, and Ryan immediately
knocked him down. At this moment the
ring was broken, and Belcher’s friends declared
the last blow was foul. Bob Watson
challenged to fight any man who should dare
to say the blow was not foul, but his bluster
soon evaporated on Joe Ward’s displaying
buff. The affair was left to the gentleman
who held the purse, and he decided that
Ryan had won it, as Belcher was beaten full
a quarter of an hour before. Many of the
dons of the first class were there, as Berks,
Mendoza, Joe Ward, Bill Warr, Jem Belcher,
Holmes, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bill was next matched with Caleb Baldwin, and fought him at Blackheath,
August 6, 1805. The interruption, the chances and changes of the fight,
and the decision, “a draw,” will be found under <span class='sc'>Caleb Baldwin</span>, Chapter
VII., Period III.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Belcher, smarting under the sense of defeat, invited Bill to a second
trial, which took place at Laleham Burway, Surrey, June 4, 1806. Ryan,
although so young a man, was so given to drinking ardent spirits, that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>was already internally diseased. He was beaten in fifty minutes, twenty-nine
rounds, but not without much difficulty. (See life of <span class='sc'>Tom Belcher</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Two months afterwards Bill made his last appearance in the ring, Tuesday,
June 17, 1806, at Wilsden Green, where he gained by his superior skill a
victory over Clark, a clumsy boxer, with not a single pretension beyond
strength and pluck.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ryan’s drunken habits now grew so rapidly upon him, that on June 23rd,
six days afterwards, he was expelled from the Fives Court, on the occasion
of the benefit of Gully and Elias Spray. Bill set-to with Richmond, and
afterwards made himself so offensive as to be formally excluded. No dependence
could be placed upon him for an hour, and training was out of the
question. He died in obscurity and poverty in the winter of 1807, date not
recorded.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ISAAC BITTOON—1801‒1804.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Isaac Bittoon, a Jew of great strength, coolness, some skill in singlestick,
fencing, and with the gloves, and well-known for more than thirty years to
the ring-going world of the last generation, deserves a place in our Appendix
for several reasons. In “Boxiana,” the error of his having beaten Paddington
Jones, July 13, 1801, originated, and has been copied into all the chronologies.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c009'><sup>[125]</sup></a>
His draw with Maddox and his great battle with Bill Wood, also
deserve preservation, and for these reasons we have given the ponderous Isaac
a niche in our history. The first-mentioned affair, the draw with George
Maddox, will be found in the life of “the Veteran,” Chapter VI. of this
Period. The second, his game fight with Bill Wood, the coachman, shall be
given from the report of the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A match having been for some time on the carpet, for fifty guineas,
between Isaac Bittoon<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c009'><sup>[126]</sup></a> (the Jew), and Bill Wood, the coachman, the
officers were on the alert to find out the time and place of the contest, but
the amateurs, always awake, kept these points secret until the night previous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>when Wilsden Green, the spot where so much courage had been displayed by
Tom Tough<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c009'><sup>[127]</sup></a> and Jack Holmes, some few months ago, was settled as the
Campus Martius; to prevent interruption it was agreed the fight should
take place at ten o’clock in the morning. Accordingly on Monday, July 16,
1804, the admirers of pugilism were active, and the field was filled at an
early hour; a ring being formed, at three quarters past ten the combatants
entered. Wood immediately began to strip, and appeared in excellent condition.
Bittoon followed in high spirits, and after the usual ceremonies they
set-to, without any very sanguine opinion being entertained on either side.”</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Wood beat down his antagonist’s
guard, and put in two blows without
any impression; Bittoon returned with his
right hand, and some hard hitting followed
by both. Wood had greatly the advantage
in strength, beat Bittoon against the ropes,
by which he became entangled. Here Wood
put in some good blows, and Bittoon fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Wood put in the first blow again.
Bittoon struck several good straight-forward
blows, rallied, and a second time fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—This round was very short. Wood
fell, Bittoon gaining advantage.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Bittoon put in several good blows, but
Wood rallied, and by superior strength drove
him to one side of the ring, where he fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Much sparring at setting-to; both
exchanged some severe hits. Wood bled
freely, but rallied Bittoon again against the
rope, and threw him. (Odds were now six
to four in favour of Bittoon, for, although
he so often fell, his blows did not disappoint
in execution.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—The sun being troublesome to Bittoon,
he manœuvred to change sides, and had
somewhat succeeded, when Wood ran in and
threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Wood still kept the shady side, and
with great exertion put in several blows
which Bittoon vainly attempted to stop, and
driving him again to the ropes, Bittoon fell.
(Odds remained, however, in favour of Bittoon,
who was still in good strength, while
Wood displayed signs of fatigue.)</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Wood immediately ran in, and closing,
threw his opponent, who when down he
patted on the head in triumph.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Bittoon on rising appeared greatly
exasperated, ran in upon Wood with much
fury, who struck him with his left hand, and
brought him down. Wood for this gained
great applause.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—In this round Bittoon resumed his
former temperance, rallied, and put in
several good hits. Wood, while making a
blow, slipped and turned round, during
which his opponent took advantage of an
opening, and threw in a severe body blow.
Wood fell. (Odds still six to four on Bittoon.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Wood showed somewhat fearful of
encountering Bittoon’s hits, but, conscious of
his strength, ran in and threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—During the intermediate rounds there
was some severe hitting, and Bittoon, by
adopting the Mendoza style, stopping and
returning with the same hand, was very successful.
This round had nearly proved fatal
to the Coachman; while rallying, Bittoon
put in a most severe blow in the stomach,
which brought him down, and he laid
breathless for some time. A cry of “Time,
time,” was vociferated, and he tried to conform
to the rules of pugilism by returning in
the half minute; this, however, he could not
do, and the multitude considering the battle
concluded, rushed in. This caused much
confusion, and gave Wood opportunity for
recovery, and the battle proceeded. (Odds
were now ten to one on Bittoon.)<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c009'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Wood exhibited symptoms of exhaustion,
and hinted to his second he could not
stand it much longer. Bittoon, on the contrary,
was in full vigour, but did not exert
his strength, as he found it unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—In this round Wood, greatly to the
surprise of every one, recovered, appeared
re-invigorated, and undoubtedly had the
best of the round. To the</p>

<p class='c022'>25th.—Wood supported a superiority, and
fought the whole of these rounds with astonishing
resolution, but the impression on
his opponent was very slight.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—During this round the conduct of the
spectators seemed to indicate a determination
that the Jew should lose the battle.
They rushed in, broke the ropes, and pulled
up the stakes. To settle this a body of
horsemen rode up, driving the crowd before
them, and after much mischief formed
another ring.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>32.—A general engagement having been
the consequence of this intrusion, there was
great confusion, and only an imperfect ring
was kept up to this round; the advantage
during this time was alternate. Bittoon fell
at the end of every round, but invariably
first cut his opponent by a severe blow in the
face. About this time the bustle began to
subside, and the battle went on again more
regularly.</p>

<p class='c022'>36.—Wood made a good stand-up fight,
and many supposed that, by Bittoon’s frequently
falling, Wood had the advantage;
but he gained more by his well-aimed hits
than his opponent did by the falls. This
round, however, finished the fight, as Wood
was quite worn out.</p>

<p class='c022'>A number of Bow Street officers had by
this time arrived, and the company retired
homewards, a little disappointed as there
were no bye-battles.</p>

<p class='c013'>Isaac, who was always a sporting character among the Israelites of the
East End, now retired from challenges, and became a licensed victualler in
Whitechapel. For many years he kept a sparring school and saloon for
fencing, singlestick, and broadsword, in Gulston Street, Whitechapel. His
weight after his retirement so immensely increased, that although his
activity was remarkable for his size (he drew at scale seventeen stone),
his appearances at the Fives Court, Tennis Court, Jackson’s Rooms, etc.,
were a standing source of amusement to the visitors. In a song chanted by
the celebrated Robert Emery, the Yorkshire comedian, of Covent Garden
Theatre, we find a verse <em>apropos</em> of this “feature” of Bittoon’s person and
of his “pluck,” then expressed by the word “bottom;” he is describing the
“qualities of the millers,”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Bittoon then came, a champion bold,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And dealt some hard and sly knocks;</div>
      <div class='line'>But yet, when all the truth is told,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Some ranked him with the shy cocks.</div>
      <div class='line'>Still prate like this we must not mind,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A Dutchman true begot ’um,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whoe’er has seen Bittoon <em>behind</em>,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Will ne’er dispute his <em>bottom</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At length, in the month of February, 1838, “Old Ikey,” after a few
weeks’ illness, breathed his last at the age of sixty, in the eastern quarter,
wherein he was so long known, and lies in the Jewish burial ground near
Bethnal Green.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BILL CROPLEY—1807‒1810.</h4>

<p class='c013'>As the antagonist of Dutch Sam and Tom Belcher, with whom he made
good fights, the name of Bill Cropley has been preserved. As a teacher of
self-defence and an exhibitor at the Fives Court for more than a quarter
of a century, he is also remembered. Cropley’s two defeats, where in both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>cases he had the misfortune to “catch a Tartar,” were balanced by other
contests which were more satisfactory in result. He successively defeated
“Jemmy from Town,” Tom Hazel, and George Cribb, brother of the
champion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first of these we find thus recorded. “An obstinate battle was this day
contested between Bill Cropley, well known at the ring side, and for years as
a shining light among the stalwart brotherhood of coal-whippers, as ‘a good
bit of stuff,’ and ‘Jemmy from Town,’ whose game qualities with Morgan and
Rolfe have procured him so much patronage. The day on which this took
place was memorable, the 7th of April, 1807, as that on which Tom Cribb
(see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>) beat Jem Belcher, and the roped ring was the same (twenty
feet square), that had been just left by those renowned gladiators. Cropley
quickly disposed of his antagonist, twenty-five minutes, eighteen rounds,
polishing off the plucky Jemmy without giving him a chance of turning the
tide of battle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cropley’s next ring fight was with an aspirant named Tom Hazel (misprinted
Lazel under Cropley, in “Fistiana”), on the 21st of August, 1807, at
Crawley Common, after Dutch Sam had conquered Tom Belcher. A subscription
purse of thirty guineas had been raised by Captain Barclay, Lord
Say and Sele, Lord Archibald Hamilton, and other amateurs, for Hazel to try
his capabilities, much being thought of his pretensions to the art. Cropley
entered the ring, but Hazel proved a mere pretender in actual combat.
Cropley took the lead and kept it, throwing all Hazel’s cleverness out, and
in fifteen rounds proving the difference between smart and courageous boxing
and clever tapping with “the mufflers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The year 1808 was unlucky for our hero. His first match was with
Dutch Sam, on April 5, for fifty guineas, but was stopped by the authorities,
as was that of Jem Belcher and Dogherty, calendared for the same day. It
accordingly went off until the 10th of May, 1808, when Gully beat Gregson
a second time at Markyate Street, Herts. The “big battle” over, Dutch
Sam and Cropley mounted the stage at half past six o’clock in the evening.
In the first round Cropley got in heavily, and nearly closed Sam’s right eye,
but this was his only gleam of success. He tried “all he knew,” but never
again effectively spotted the wily Israelite. Sam was too active, and in
twenty-five minutes Cropley’s last chance was gone. Bill gave in at the
general desire of the amateurs, though he wished to fight on: it was seven
o’clock, and all were “homeward bound.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On Saturday, June 11, after the fight of Dogherty and Pentikin, a talk
about the merits of the recent battle between Bill Cropley and Dutch Sam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>led to some difference of opinion, and an amateur posted fifty guineas for Bill
to fight Tom Belcher in the same ring as Gregson and Tom Cribb (October
28th, 1808). Accordingly, at Moulsey Hurst, the heroes met, when Cropley
fell, but not discreditably, as may be seen in the life of <span class='sc'>Tom Belcher</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>,
Chapter II., Period III.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cropley’s last ring fight was with George Cribb, on Friday, August 9th,
1809, at Pope’s Head Watch House, Reinbow, near Margate, after Richmond
the Black had beaten the veteran George Maddox. (See Life of
<span class='sc'>Richmond</span>, Period IV.)</p>

<p class='c007'>George proved a clumsy and slow fighter, a mere receiver-general. He
fought desperately and heavily for sixteen minutes, but at the end of that
short time was completely “told out,” and taken away by his friends.
“The match was extremely unequal,” says the report, “Cropley being equal
to Dutch Sam in skill, and much quicker than Cribb.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From this time we hear of Cropley as a second and a sparrer for a number
of years. As late as May 1821, in a kind of supplementary summary of
“Boxers who have retired,” Pierce Egan thus notices the subject of these
lines. “Bill Cropley, in his day an excellent fighter. His contests with
Dutch Sam and Tom Belcher will always preserve his name from obscurity;
but, having no patron [he must have been going on for fifty], he follows his
occupation as a coal-whipper, but also keeps a school for the minor amateurs.
He seldom exhibits now.” “Boxiana,” second edition, vol. iii., p. 554.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have not found the date of Cropley’s death.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOM BLAKE (TOM TOUGH)—1804‒1810.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Tom Blake, a civil and ready fellow, whose boyish days had been passed
in the navy, deserves a corner in these records of the ring. We shall pass
Tom’s “outside” affairs, which were numerous, to come at once to his battle
with Jack Holmes, the Coachman, long remembered as one of the most
remarkable of the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great company of the patrons of the fistic art having been drawn
together by the great battle of Pearce, the Game Chicken, and Berks,
January 23rd, 1804, a proposition was made, and a purse of 20 guineas
raised, as a prize to be contested for in a few days by two pugilistic heroes,
to be approved as a fair match by the contributors to the stake.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“The candidates, principally second-rate, were very numerous, and from
them were selected two boxers, both well-known in the fighting world, and
possessed of true bottom. These were Tom Blake, better known by the
appellation of ‘Tom Tough,’ and Jack Holmes, a son of Jehu, who in
the year 1794 contested a desperate battle in Harley Fields.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c009'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“The cash being properly fixed and arranged, St. George’s-row, near the
Paddington Canal, the spot where Belcher and Berks first contested, was
determined for the battle. Early on the Monday morning, a great crowd
having assembled, the owner of the field sent to give information at Bow
Street. This the combatants heard, and immediately resolved to start for
Wilsden Green, about four miles from town. On their arrival a ring was
formed, and at half past twelve the combatants entered, stripped and set-to.
Odds six to four in favour of Tom Tough.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Holmes put in the first blow
on his opponent’s left side; this rather staggered
him, and following him up, put in a
bit with his left hand and brought him
down. (Odds immediately changed six to
four in favour of the coachman.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2 to 11.—During the whole of the ten
rounds neither of the combatants tried by
any manœuvre to evade the blow of his
opponent. At the commencement of each
round there was no shifting, no attempts at
closing, or endeavours to throw each other
down, but immediately on setting to one put
in a blow, which was returned and manfully
supported both right and left, until a hit
brought one or other down. This having
been the coachman’s bad luck for the last
three rounds, odds changed much against
him, as high as four to one.</p>

<p class='c022'>12 to 17.—Tom for the two first of these
rounds displayed great advantage. In both
he brought down his opponent by the first
blow. The four following rounds were, however,
more fairly contested; neither showed
any signs of distress, and neither could claim
any advantage.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—This round was contested with as
much spirit as though the battle was really
depending on the issue. Tom, however,
had the advantage. Great applause.</p>

<p class='c022'>20 to 26.—Both fought with unabated
desperation. The odds incessantly varied,
being, during these rounds, six to four in
favour of one or other of the combatants.
Every round brought down great applause,
from their astonishing exertions. Tom’s
side by this time exhibited marks of many
well planted blows, being perfectly raw.
(Odds were, however, three to one in his
favour.)</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—This round had nearly proved fatal
to Tom Tough, as the coachman nearly
carried away his bowsprit. He twisted
round, but did not fall, and tacking about
put in a severe blow on the coachman’s larboard
side, but fell from his own blow.
(Odds were now three to one in favour of
the coachman.)</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—Tom came up quite lame; he had
sprained his knee in the fall, and could only
with great pain point his foot to the earth.
His seconds and friends wished him to give
up, but Tom insisted on another broadside.
Tom being lame, waited for his opponent’s
coming up, and throwing out his left hand,
struck him and brought him down. This,
however, was considered as only chance, or
that perhaps Holmes slipped, and odds of
ten to four were offered against Tom. From
this to the</p>

<p class='c022'>34th.—Tom every round stood firmly,
waiting for the attack of his adversary.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>35.—In this round Tom greatly recovered
of his lameness, and got in better spirits.
During the round he patted Holmes on the
cheek, and said, “Thou’rt a good fellow,
but must be beat.” (Odds in Tom’s favour
again.)</p>

<p class='c022'>41.—Holmes rallied, knocked down Tom,
and evidently had the best of the round.
The combatants continued the contest up
to the</p>

<p class='c022'>48th.—Both hitting as hard as at first.
Holmes’ face was now even worse beat than
Joe Berks’ during any of his battles, and
Tom’s side was sad to behold. Tom, however,
was now the favourite.</p>

<p class='c022'>49 to 51.—The first of these rounds Holmes
had the advantage, brought down his opponent
in style. Tom, however, perceiving
Holmes showed signs of being faint, fought
more sprightly, and having put in a tolerably
successful blow, any odds were offered
that “coachee” would not touch collar
again; but greatly to the astonishment of
all, the coachman rallied, and in the last
round made a wonderful effort to beat down
his opponent, and succeeded. This round
the one upon which the coachman
depended for the success of the battle, for
though he struggled hard for the superiority
up to the sixtieth round, he failed in
the attempt, and yielded.</p>

<p class='c022'>Holmes’ defeat was considered so much
more to his credit than several of his “outside”
victories, that the amateurs made a
liberal collection on his behalf before leaving
the ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>Blake certainly vindicated his popular cognomen, of “Tom Tough,” in
this encounter. His name is “familiar as a household word,” through the
ring combats of Cribb, Maddox, Richmond, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Tom Cribb, “the novice,” had beaten old Maddox, January 7th,
1805, Tom Blake seems to have thought himself clever enough to try it
on with the rising “young ’un,” for a purse of 40 guineas, at Blackheath,
February 15, 1806. This proved a sad miscalculation. The embryo
champion had height, reach, weight, and youth on his side, and poor Tom
was finished by a cross-buttock in the last round but one, after an hour’s
gallant but hopeless struggle. “Belcher, Ward, Mendoza, Bittoon, Berks,
Maddox, and Jack Holmes were present, and a leading amateur offered to
back Cribb against any pugilist living, but no one accepted the challenge.”
(See life of <span class='sc'>Tom Cribb</span>, Period IV., Chapter 1.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Five years afterwards, when forty years old, Tom, rough, tough, and
ready, offered himself as a “trial-horse” for the much talked of “young
black,” Tom Molineaux. There is no mistaking the pluck of this offer,
whatever we may think of its discretion. But as Blake is said to have
expressed it, “If he’s ever so good it’ll only be one hiding more, and at
any rate I’ll find out what stuff’s in him,” the match went on. The battle
took place on the coast, a few miles from Margate. Tom Cribb, by a curious
coincidence, seconded Tom Blake, and Richmond—under whose patronage
Molineaux then was—seconded his brother black. The resolution of Blake
upheld his established fame; he was hit completely out of time by the fresh
and powerful young American. The report will be found under <span class='sc'>Molineaux</span>,
Chapter II., Period IV.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this period Tom confined himself to the functions of a second or
bottle-holder. In November, 1814, poor Tom, despite his toughness, caught
his death-cold; he was laid up with rheumatic fever, and finally died of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>attack of paralysis, early in 1815. Tom’s battles were always courageous,
and in his earlier day remarkably dexterous and skilful. His gameness
rendered him formidable, and his endurance, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">teste</span></i> his battle with Holmes,
and later with Tom Cribb, fully evidenced that his alias, “Tom Tough,”
was a well-bestowed title.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BOB GREGSON—1807‒1809.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c009'><sup>[130]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c013'>Few men were more widely known in the sporting circles of London,
for the few years that he made the metropolis his home, than the burly,
bigboned, gigantic landlord of “Bob’s Chophouse,” better known as the
Castle, Holborn; the head-quarters of pugilism in the great days of the
Belchers, Cribbs, and Tom Spring; the first and last, for a long series of
years, being bonifaces of this well-known hostelry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gregson was born July 21st, 1778, at Heskin, three miles from Chorley,
and ten from Preston, Lancashire; and we have Pierce Egan’s word for it,
who doubtless had it from Bob’s own lips, that he commanded the Liverpool
and Wigan Packet, for several years with credit and respect. What follows
is somewhat strange. “For the period of seven years, all the pugilistic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>heroes of Lancashire, as well as those from other parts, that met him in
combat, surrendered to his conquering arm, and the name of Gregson was
resounded from one end to the other as the proud champion of that most
populous county. His pitched battles were numerous; but the skirmishes of
Bob were by far too frequent for us to treat upon, and we have, therefore,
slightly touched on those achievements which claim a prominency of feature.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain of “the Liverpool and Wigan Packet,” must have had his
hands pretty full, for besides “all the pugilistic heroes of Lancashire, as well
as those from other parts,” Bob Gregson is related to have beaten a rival for
the hand and affections of Mrs. G., of the name of Harry Mandersley; after
which one “Ned Waller, a sort of second champion of the county,” had to
be disposed of, which he of course was. James Ayschire, Ned Prescot, James
Benton, “one Tom Dawber,” Robert Fance, Tom Wright, Bill Hallrop,
and other real or phantom boxers, all fall in succession before Gregson’s
“conquering arm,” each under circumstances minutely manufactured with a
detail and diffuseness that may well excite the envy of the most prolix
penny-a-liner that ever stuffed out emptiness with verbose nothings. Finally
Pierce brings down the “tremendous Joe Berks,” introducing him in the
following choice rhodomontade:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The tremendous Joe Berks now made his appearance in Manchester,
threatening destruction to all the pugilists in the county, who should have
the temerity to enter the lists with him, when Gregson was once more called
upon to avenge the honour of his native soil, and to expel, if possible, this daring
invader. It was a truly brave contest, and the gluttony of this pugilistic
cormorant was never more completely satisfied, and who publicly declared a
short time afterwards, that his appetite had never been good since that period.
The battle took place at Higher Hardwicke, when after forty minutes had
elapsed Berks acknowledged Gregson to be his master.” Need we say, after
a perusal of Berks’ memoir, that the whole of this is pure invention.
Gregson and Berks never met. The historian proceeds, “Soon after this
circumstance,” the imaginary encounter with Joe Berks, “Bob’s prospects in
life experienced a material change, owing to a severe domestic calamity,
in the loss of an amiable and affectionate partner; and he now not only
bid [bade] adieu to Lancashire, but in all probability to pugilism in future, in
being presented with a commission in the army, which regiment, named
after the county, was quartered at Plymouth, to which place Gregson
repaired, to join the standard; but finding that his finances were not able to
support the character of an officer with that respectability which such a
situation required, he relinquished the project, and entered, rather imprudently,
into the gay pursuits of fashion at that place, that when he
arrived in the metropolis, to use a sporting phrase, he was nearly cleaned
out. Bob now experienced some vicissitudes—facts are stubborn things—and
it was from the necessity of the moment only, that Gregson was induced
to enter the ring again as a pugilist.” Of this we may believe as much or as
little as we please. The Lancashire hero’s first interview with John Gully,
seems, however, somewhat inconsistent with “behaviour becoming an officer
and a gentleman,” as the phrase runs. His eulogist shall tell it in his own
words: “Upon Bob’s first meeting with Gully, at a public house, some
harsh epithets passed between them, when Gregson, to show his strength
took Gully up under his arm, and threw him down on the ground; upon
which a match was the consequence between those heroes.” This is pretty
good. We will not, however, pursue this branch of the subject further.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c009'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p>BOB GREGSON.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Gregson, who stood six feet one inch and a half in height, and weighed
fifteen stone six pounds, was a Lancashire rough, of undaunted courage,
immense endurance, trusting to brute strength for victory, and falling before
skilful practitioners of the art of self-defence. His battles with Gully at
Newmarket, October 14, 1807; and at Markyate Street, Herts., May 10,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>1808 (for which see life of <span class='sc'>John Gully</span>); with Tom Cribb, at Moulsey,
October 25, 1808 (see life of <span class='sc'>Tom Cribb</span>), sufficiently illustrate his strength
and courage. As to Gregson’s poetical merits, whereon Pierce Egan expatiates
in several pages of his own marvellous prose, we may pass them safely
to the limbo of lost reputations; lest, however, we should be thought
invidious, we will give the <em>best</em> stanza we can find among the specimens
preserved in “Boxiana,” vol. i., p. 358, in the Appendix of “Prime Chaunts

<p class='c007'>With this specimen of crambo the reader will be satisfied. Some really
clever poetical effusions from the pens of Mr. Hunter, of Southampton, Mr.
Vincent Dowling and others, which from time to time adorned the columns
of <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite>, will occur among the records of passing ring events,
and these we shall gladly transfer to the enlivening of the pages of our
history.</p>

<p class='c007'>From 1808 to 1814, when Tom Belcher succeeded him as landlord of the
Castle, “Bob’s Chop-house,” as it was called, was the head quarters of ring
patrons and pugilists. As a business speculation, however, Gregson did not
make it pay. The celebrated Yorkshire actor, Robert Emery, of Covent
Garden, appears to have been a staunch patron of Bob’s, taking the chair at
his opening dinner, and contributing his great vocal and conversational talents
to his service on festive occasions. On one of these we find a song containing
a stanza laudatory of Bob, in which his early position as the commander
of a packet is clearly mentioned:—</p>

<p class='c007'>After an attempt at establishing a sparring school in London, Gregson left
the metropolis for Dublin, where his peculiar merits were more likely to be
appreciated. He opened the rooms once occupied by the “Royal Irish
Academy,” as a “School for teaching the art of self-defence,” and is said
to have been “well supported by the first class of amateurs in Dublin.”
In April, 1819, Gregson was in London, and took a benefit at the theatre in
Catherine Street, Strand, at which Donnelly, “the Irish champion,” showed,
with an arm lamed by an accident. In August, 1819, Donnelly, George
Cooper and Gregson, were on a sparring tour in Ireland, and later we find
Bob figuring as the landlord of “the Punch House,” Moor Street, Dublin.
In 1824, Gregson, whose health had been for some time failing, died at
Liverpool, in the month of November, and lies buried in St. Nicholas’
churchyard.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h4 class='c016'>THOMAS CRIBB, CHAMPION OF ENGLAND.—1805‒1820.</h4>

<p class='c013'>“Advance, brave Broughton!” exclaims Captain Godfrey, with manly
enthusiasm; “thee I pronounce Captain of the Boxers!” Had the worthy
and trueborn writer of “the Characters” lived in the nineteenth century,
he would have bestowed this compliment on “honest and brave Old Tom.”
Since first the honour of champion was a coveted and distinguished prize
for men of bold heart and iron sinew, for men of forbearing coolness and
pain-defying fortitude, down to these evil days of wrangle, chaffing, bullying,
and shifting, a more straightforward, excellent, simple-hearted, generous,
and brave man than Tom Cribb, never held the hard-won trophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are curious parallels to be traced in pugilistic as well as public
annals, which exemplify the sagacious remark of a philosophic writer, that
history is always repeating itself. Thus renown awakens emulation in other
hearts, and bold adventurers are ready to challenge imputed superiority. In
such competitions with man, horse, or hound, in athletic exercises, in
courage, endurance, and in cool self-reliance even against odds physical
or numerical, England has no cause to blush for her sons. In the days
of Fig, we have seen that a Venetian gondolier, a formidable fellow,
vaunted as “the strongest man in Europe,” proposed to tear the champion’s
wreath from—</p>

<p>THOMAS CRIBB (<span class='sc'>Champion of England</span>).<br /><br /><em>From the Painting by</em> <span class='sc'>De Wild</span>, 1811.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>In the time of Cribb, the descendant of an African race, remarkable for
insensibility to pain, a low cerebral development, and immense muscular
powers, challenged the belt, was met by Tom Cribb, defeated, and died
a self-destroyed victim to his mortification and reckless excess. In our own
time an Irish-American of superior stature, weight, and physique, with
the advantages of youth, activity, and unexhausted energy, offered himself
as challenger of the belt, which might well be taken as the symbol of the
championship of the world. Its holder was a middle weight, whose many
hard fought battles had left him outward marks on his person, and still
more told upon his elasticity and lasting powers. Yet Tom Sayers undauntedly
met the defiance, and the result, though unsatisfactory in the
main, showed what lion-hearted courage and a determination to “do or die”
can achieve. The trophy was retained in our little “nook-shotten isle,”
again to be contended for by Englishmen, though “open to all comers,”
without regard to country and colour. But we are anticipating our history,
which has now to do with the honest, hearty, and gallant Tom Cribb.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cribb was born July 8th, 1781, at Hanham, in the parish of Bitton,
Gloucester, on the borders of Somerset, situate about five miles from Bristol,
and it is rather a disputed point to which of the counties contiguous to
Hanham this spot belongs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pierce Egan, from Cribb’s own lips, has compiled a diffuse account of his
earlier career, to which we are indebted for the following particulars:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Our hero left his native place at a very early period, and arrived in
the metropolis, when no more than thirteen years old, to follow the trade
of a bell-hanger, under the guidance of a relative; but the confined occupation
of hanging bells not exactly meeting his ideas, and being a strong
youth, he preferred an out-door calling, and commenced porter at the wharfs,
during which time he met with two accidents that had nearly deprived him
of existence—in stepping from one coal barge to another, he fell between
them, and got jammed in a dreadful manner; and in carrying a very heavy
package of oranges, weighing nearly 500 pounds, he slipped upon his back,
and the load fell upon his chest, which occasioned him to spit blood for
several days afterwards. By the excellence of his constitution, he was soon
enabled to recover his strength from those severe accidents; and aided by the
invigorating air of the ocean, upon which he had the honour of serving
against the enemies of his country, his fine natural stamina was improved.
The natural good temper and forbearance of this brave man has left his
historian little to record in the way of skirmishes; and the important contests
which it will become our duty and pleasing task to record, were all conducted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>on the principles of professional boxing—the very first elements of which
are manliness, forbearance, and fair play. Though Cribb was generally
considered a slow fighter, he was as generally admired as a sure hitter; his
wind was of the first quality, and his game never excelled. With such
sound pugilistic pretensions it will not appear surprising that Tom quickly
scaled his way to fame and fortune, in which career we shall leave his
actions to speak for themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the beginning of 1805, Cribb fought his first public battle with that
veteran of fistic glory, George Maddox, on Wood Green, near Highgate,
January 7th, 1805, for a subscription purse of twenty-five guineas—twenty
for the winner and five for the loser. The disparity of years was considerable
between the combatants; and Cribb, besides possessing the advantages of
youth, was somewhat taller than Maddox, and, consequently rather the
favourite.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we find no report, beyond a mere mention of this fight in “Boxiana,”
or elsewhere, we give the brief account we find in the weekly papers: “On
Monday (January 7), at Wood Green, about two miles north of Highgate,
a severe boxing match took place, between the pugilistic veteran, George
Maddox (in his 50th year), and Thomas Cribb, a young man, who had never
entered the lists before, but known in the neighbourhood of Wapping, where
he has been working as a coal-porter, as ‘the Black Diamond.’ Maddox’s
second was Tom Jones, and Black Sam sympathetically seconded the Black
Diamond.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The contest was for an amateur subscription purse of 25 guineas, 20 for
the winner, and five for the loser. A ring having been formed, at about
twelve o’clock the combatants entered. On stripping appearances were
greatly in favour of Cribb; he being a well made man, standing five feet
ten inches, about two inches taller than Maddox. After the usual ceremonies
they set-to.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—This was little more than sparring.
The Diamond put in a blow, but no
harm done.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Well contested. Maddox showed considerable
skill, and finished it by closing his
opponent’s eye. (Odds rose two to one in
favour of George.) From this to the</p>

<p class='c022'>30th.—Nothing of consequence happened;
both men fought desperately, Maddox with
great tact as well as pluck, and each endeavoured
to out-do his opponent. Maddox
by this time finding his antagonist possessed
good bottom, exerted his utmost to blind
him, and hit always at his head, Cribb
fighting with undaunted courage.</p>

<p class='c022'>40.—By this time they had fought exactly
an hour, and Cribb’s eye was severely hurt.
(Odds four to one on Maddox.) To the</p>

<p class='c022'>52nd.—Was a continued series of hard
fighting.</p>

<p class='c022'>53.—Odds again rose in favour of Maddox,
and he put in a most severe blow a little
beneath his opponent’s left eye, which perfectly
closed it. The fight had now lasted
one hour and a half; but from this to the</p>

<p class='c022'>60th.—Maddox continued to lose ground,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>becoming almost worn out. The friends and
partisans of Maddox perceiving this, got up
a row in another part of the ring, and his seconds
led him off, declaring it a drawn battle.
On this Cribb demanded the purse; but this
was refused, and a general engagement ensued.
Caleb Baldwin, Tom Jones, Black Sam,
Dutch Sam, and the spectators took a very
active share. During the scuffle some ruffian
treacherously cut Cribb over the head
with a stick. Order, however, was, after
some time, restored, and Cribb insisted
either on the purse or that his antagonist
should return to the combat. This generous
offer was to Maddox’s friends a perfect poser,
but rather than lose ‘the cole,’ they brought
George out of a hackney coach to renew the
fight, and the combatants again set-to.
They supported the contest for sixteen
rounds, making in all seventy-six, and the
time two hours and twelve minutes, when
George, thoroughly exhausted, gave in.
Cribb, having but just come forward, found
but few friends, and consequently was obliged
to put up with much unfair play.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the contemporary report, and one that shows that the “win, tie,
or wrangle” school is not altogether modern, and that ruffians at the ring
side, as elsewhere, were among our grandfathers as in the present time.
Cribb’s reputation rose greatly by the coolness, even temper, and game
he displayed, as a novice contending against one of the best and most
experienced tacticians of his time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Cribb was well in three days, and at the Fives Court, where
he was challenged by Tom Blake (Tom Tough). See Appendix, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 236.
Preliminaries were quickly arranged, and a month’s time given, February
15th, 1805, being appointed, on which day they met on Blackheath. We
quote the report:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Both parties had been a month in training.
All the patrons and admirers of pugilism
having gained information on the preceding
evening of the seat of combat, early
in the morning Blackheath was thronged.
A ring was formed, and about eleven o’clock
Cribb entered, accompanied by Richmond,
the black, and Joe Norton, as his seconds.
Blake soon followed, with Dick Hall and
Webb, for his attendants. They stripped,
and immediately set-to. Bets even, but
odds generally considered in favour of Cribb,
from his known agility and skill. The combatants
met each other with great eagerness,
and each put in some exceedingly good
blows. For a quarter of an hour bets remained
stationary, and both champions in
that time had displayed a degree of science
and courage almost unprecedented. Cribb,
however, being longer in the reach than his
opponent, it was seldom Blake could effectively
get home a blow. At the end of an
hour Blake began to show great symptoms
of distress, and odds were now strongly betted
in favour of Cribb. Still Blake stood up
manfully, and displayed a great deal of his
usual dexterity. Until within the two last
rounds of the battle, Cribb astonishingly
supported his advantage; but here Blake
brought his utmost, both in strength and
skill, into action. He put in several excellent
straight hits about his opponent’s head;
Cribb rallied most determinedly. Blake
recovered and returned to the rally, but
overreaching himself, Cribb threw him a
cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c022'>The next round decided the contest;
Blake found he was fighting at an overpowering
disadvantage, and gave in. Blake
was extremely weak; he could hardly stand;
and Cribb showed marks of his antagonist’s
dexterity.</p>

<p class='c022'>Belcher, Warr, Mendoza, Bittoon, Berks,
Maddox, and Jack Holmes were there.
Several amateurs offered to back Cribb
against any pugilist going, but no one accepted
the challenge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cribb was not allowed to rest long upon the laurels he had thus acquired
by two victories in two months. A ponderous Jew, known as Ikey Pig,
well known among the sparring schools, fancied he could take the shine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>out of the Black Diamond, whom many declared to be “slow as a top.”
Fifty guineas was posted, and Blackheath named as the rendezvous. On
May 21st, 1805, the battle came off. Tom Jones seconded Cribb, and Will
Wood, the coachman, picked up the Jew.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first quarter of an hour Ikey made good use of his strength. He
closed at the end of each round, and brought Cribb down heavily more than
once. Cribb fought very steadily and cautiously, generally drawing his man
after him. Being, however, down and undermost at the end of several
rounds, superficial observers thought that Cribb had the worst of it, and
betted against him. In the eighth and ninth rounds, however, though Cribb
was down, Ikey’s friends perceived their man had much the worst of it.
He was not only much disfigured but sadly distressed by some heavy half-arm
hits which Cribb had delivered with the right on his left side. They
fought two more rounds, making eleven in all, when Ikey, who was terribly
distressed, refused to fight any more, alleging that he had sprained his wrist.
“This defeat sadly mortified many of the Israelites, who considered Ikey had
shown ‘the white feather.’ It was afterwards, however, agreed that he
had no chance of victory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cribb was unquestionably “going the pace,” and “it is the pace that
kills.” The next month (June), he was matched to fight George Nicholls,
on the 20th July. They met at Broadwater, and here Cribb experienced
his first and last defeat. The details will be found under Nicholls’ memoir
in the Appendix to this Period.</p>

<p class='c007'>As colour or country made no difference to Tom Cribb, any more than to
his smaller successor Tom Sayers, Cribb entered the ring on the 8th October,
1805, with Bill Richmond, the black, at Hailsham, Sussex, after Gully had
been defeated by the accomplished Pearce, the Game Chicken. The purse
was 25 guineas, twenty to the winner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At any other time,” says the reporter, “a contest between these men
would have demanded the greatest attention, but so highly were the minds
of the amateurs excited by the merit of the first contenders, that little notice
seemed paid to the present battle. To call it a battle, however, is to disgrace
the synonyme of fight. It was a most unequal match. Richmond, finding
he could not get at his steady and formidable opponent, hopped and danced
about the ring, sometimes falling down, at others jigging round in the style
of an Otaheitan dance. Cribb appeared somewhat puzzled by his opponent’s
long black pegs, and could not be persuaded to go in and lick him off hand,
as every one knew was well in his power. Twenty minutes elapsed without
a single blow of any consequence passing. In this manner they spun it out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>for one hour and a half, when Cribb was acknowledged the victor, without
being the least hurt. Among the numerous sporting equestrians present
was the Duke of Clarence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cribb now rose into general notice, and John Jackson having introduced
him to the renowned Captain Barclay, of Ury (of whom more anon), that
excellent judge quickly perceived his natural good qualities; he took him in
hand, trained him under his own eye, and backed him for 200 guineas against
the famous Jem Belcher, whose <em>prestige</em> was still so great, that, despite the
loss of an eye, six to four was laid upon him so soon as the match was made.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the classic hurst of Moulsey, on the 8th April, 1807, in a twenty feet
roped ring, Tom Cribb and Jem Belcher met. Gully and Bob Watson,
of Bristol, waited upon Belcher; Bill Warr and Bill Richmond (last defeated
by Cribb), waited on the champion.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The science on both sides was
shown in the excellence of their defensive
attitudes; Belcher’s, however, was far the
most graceful and unconstrained. Belcher
broke ground, and got in two light hits left
and right on the body of his opponent, which
were returned slightly by Cribb, who rallied,
closed, and was thrown by Belcher.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Belcher put in two severe blows upon
Cribb’s head and body, when the latter
returned a hit, but slipped down upon his
hands in attempting to follow it up. Cribb
showed the first blood.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Several severe blows were exchanged,
when Cribb threw Belcher, who planted a
heavy body blow while in the act of falling.
This round rather in favour of Cribb.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Cribb displayed good science in warding
off two blows of Belcher’s, when they
closed and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Belcher with his right hand put in a
dreadful blow on Cribb’s left eye, and in
closing hit his opponent twice in the body,
and threw him. (Five to two on Belcher.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Cribb began to show symptoms of
weakness. Belcher put in a hit, warding off
which caused Cribb to fall.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Belcher’s punishment was now visible
on the body of Cribb, who endeavoured to
put in two blows, which were parried by
Belcher, and Jem returned both right and
left with great dexterity, and rallied his man
to the ropes, when Cribb clung to them, and
fell much fatigued; Belcher also went down
on his knees, but seemed in good spirits.
(Three to one on Jem.)</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—A good supply of home-brewed from
Cribb; hitting and retreating neatly on both
sides; when they closed and both went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Belcher hit his adversary right and
left, but only the latter told, when Jem fell
from the force of his own blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Belcher commenced this round with
great spirit, and gave Cribb some severe
blows, without letting him have a chance;
following and rallying his opponent to the
ropes, when Cribb, appearing quite fatigued,
fell. (The odds now rose four to one on
Jem.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Belcher planted two hits, which
Cribb skilfully warded off, but Belcher was
so rapid in closing upon his antagonist, that
they both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—A small change was now making its
appearance between the combatants—Cribb
seemed rather gaining his strength, while
Belcher appeared rather distressed from his
exertions; Cribb rallied successfully, planted
a hit under Belcher’s perfect eye, closed,
and threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Belcher in all his contests never
showed himself to greater advantage than
in this round; his skill was of the finest
order, and only equalled by his courage.
In closing, Belcher threw Cribb.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Both on the alert. Belcher let go
both right and left, which were parried by
Cribb, who returned two blows in the body,
when they closed and fell. (Still four to
one on Belcher.)</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Belcher, full of gaiety, rallied Cribb
to the extremity of the ring, and, in struggling,
put an end to the round by falling.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Cribb stopped Belcher’s blows with
great skill. The knowing ones were, at this
period of the battle, rather at a stand-still
with regard to sporting their money. Cribb,
it was certain, by his appearance, had received
severe punishment, but not enough to
satisfy anything like his gluttony and Belcher’s
stamina had been considered on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>decline previous to the contest, and it was
apprehended that he could not last.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Belcher, still confident, forced the
fighting, until Cribb fell from fatigue.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Belcher put in some severe blows in
the body, and followed them with a heavy
right-hander on the throat of his opponent,
and Cribb fell violently, and quite exhausted.
It was in this round that Belcher sprained
his wrist, and was almost deprived of the
use of his right hand afterwards.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Belcher slipped in making play.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—The combatants closed and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Cribb planted two blows on his opponent’s
head, who slipped in returning them.
It was now perceived that Belcher proved
incorrect in his distances, and that several of
his blows were thrown away, from the bad
state of his eye.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Belcher, full of gaiety, put in a good
hit, and threw Cribb a cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Cribb the most conspicuous in the
round, when they closed and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Cribb put in a tremendous blow, and
in attempting to follow it up, Belcher
shifted, and Cribb ran himself down.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—The constitution of Belcher was now
giving way; his strength was not able to
resist the heavy punishment of Cribb, who
hit Jem from him, and gave him a leveller.
Cribb upon this became the favourite.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—A well-contested round, and, notwithstanding
Belcher gave Cribb a cross-buttock,
it was considered in favour of the
latter.</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—Belcher made a hit, which was
warded off by his opponent and returned,
when they closed and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—Without hesitation Cribb closed, and,
from his uncommon strength, threw Belcher
over the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—After slight exchanges, Belcher fell
from a very slight hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—A good round, without any particular
advantage to either; though Cribb put in
the most blows, yet Belcher gave his adversary
a violent fall.</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—Both closed and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—Belcher, quite game, endeavoured to
make the best of it, but Cribb rallied and
threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>34, 35, and 36.—In all these rounds Cribb
maintained the superiority.</p>

<p class='c022'>37.—Belcher had scarcely any strength
left to stand, and his brave opponent was
not in a much better state; and from this
period to the fortieth it was little better
than mere hugging, blows they could not be
called, from the exhausted state of both the
combatants.</p>

<p class='c022'>41 and last.—Thirty-five minutes had now
elapsed, and Cribb proving the stronger
man, put in two weak blows, when Belcher,
quite exhausted, fell upon the ropes, and
gave up the contest.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Every one present could not
but feel surprised at the astonishing improvement
Cribb had made in the science of pugilism.
In all his preceding contests he had
only displayed the pluck of a novice, but in
this he showed himself equal to his opponent
in stopping and measuring his distances.
Had it been generally known that he had so
amply possessed these qualities, as well as
his astonishing game, the result might have
been anticipated. Notwithstanding this just
praise is paid to Cribb’s merit, he cannot be
considered equally scientific with his unsuccessful
opponent. He was decidedly slow,
and until after the hit he so dexterously put
in on Belcher’s perfect eye, and the latter
had sprained his wrist, he stood a doubtful
chance. Belcher fought with all that vigour
and skill which ever were his characteristics,
but seemed incapable of judging his distances
accurately.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the above somewhat meagre report of this battle, it will be gathered
that notwithstanding the strength of Cribb, who was nearly two stone
heavier than his opponent, he was only just able to pull through against
the wonderful skill and activity of Jem Belcher. Indeed, it is said in
“Boxiana,” that had it not been for the manœuvring of Bill Warr, the
boot would have been on the other leg. It appears that in the eighteenth
round, when Cribb fell exhausted, Gully, who was seconding Belcher, was
so satisfied that Cribb could not come to time, that he offered five to one
to Warr that Belcher had won. Bill accepted the bet, and then craftily
insisted that it should be staked. This ceremony, although only occupying
a minute, gave sufficient time to enable a glutton like Cribb to recover
himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>George Cribb, who was emulous of his brother’s fame, made his first
unsuccessful effort with Horton, a big provincial boxer, of the Bristol School.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Horton, whose only claim to survive in ring history is the fact of his having
fought Tom Cribb, beat “the young ’un” in twenty-five minutes. The
report, given in “Pancratia,” p. 302, says, “Cribb, like his more distinguished
brother, fights too slow, while Horton, who is a rare doublehanded
fellow, hit him abroad every round. Horton, when the battle was
over, offered to fight either Tom Cribb or John Gully, but both declined.”
Tom, however, merely waited, and Gully had already a match on with
Gregson, and, therefore, Mister Horton’s challenge looks much like “bounce.”
In January, 1808, Cribb accepted the challenge of Horton; the latter being
under the care and tuition of Pearce, the Game Chicken. The stake was
100 guineas, ten posted as a forfeit, and the fight to come off in the same
ring as Gully and Gregson’s battle. From the flourishing accounts of
Horton’s improvement in sparring while on a tour with the “Chicken,”
all but Captain Barclay, and a few firm friends of Cribb, declined laying
any odds. The combat came off on the 10th May, 1808, at Markyate
Street, Herts. The absorbing interest of the Gully and Gregson contest
seems to have prevented the reporters from doing justice to this battle,
which, nevertheless, was a poor one-sided affair. If young George had
no chance with Horton, Horton had less with “brother Tom.” At the
close of the first round six to four was betted upon Cribb, which increased
to two and three to one soon afterwards. Tom’s steadiness and safe
milling qualities made it merely a question of time. Twenty-five rounds,
however, for Cribb was never in a hurry, were required before Horton gave
in utterly beaten.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sporting world was now divided in opinion as to the pugilistic merits of
the burly host of the Castle, Bob Gregson, and Tom Cribb. It was maintained
by one party that Gregson, though overmatched by the skill of Gully, who
had now formally retired from the championship, would shine conspicuously
from his great strength and pluck, if matched against such “a slow one”
(for on this point Cribb’s opponents, like Tom Sayers’, always insisted).
Accordingly in June, 1808, when Gully and Cribb had a joint benefit at the
Fives Court, a challenge was given, and Tuesday, October 25th, 1808,
fixed as the day of battle. Moulsey Hurst, in a thirty feet roped ring, was
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus in quo</span></i>, and for the details we quote the <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The dreadful beating Gregson had received from Gully, so far from
disheartening him, only tended to make him tenfold solicitous for another
chance of acquiring pugilistic fame. Major Morgan, his last backer, however,
declined patronising him; but he soon found another friend in the Marquis
of Tweeddale. Paul Methuen, Esq., backed Cribb in this contest.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>A thirty feet ring having been formed, at half past twelve the combatants
entered; Cribb attended by Gully and Bill Gibbons, and Gregson with his
seconds, Jem Belcher and Richmond. Odds five to four in favour of Cribb,
more betters than takers. At a quarter before one they set-to.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c009'><sup>[133]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The instant Cribb shook hands
he stept back, and assumed his attitude.
Short sparring, each anxious for the first
hit. Gregson attempted to lead with his
left hand, but his distance was ill-judged,
and fell short. Cribb was also ineffectual,
as his blow went over his opponent’s shoulder.
They closed, and both fell, Gregson
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Cribb put in two body blows, right
and left. Gregson made a courageous attempt
to hit Cribb, who shifted and avoided
him dexterously, and immediately threw in
a severe hit in the right side of the face with
his left hand. Blood issued from the cut
profusely, and never ceased during the combat.
Gregson lost his temper, and threw in
some desperate blows in the neck, which,
had Cribb not partially avoided, it was supposed
would have ended the contest. Cribb
rallied, and threw his opponent. (Odds two
to one in Cribb’s favour.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Gregson rallied, and put in a severe
hit under Cribb’s ear; Cribb retreated, according
to his usual mode of fighting, and
Gregson following him, he at every retreating
step put in a severe hit with his left
hand on the right side of Gregson’s face.
Gregson, however, followed up until he fell,
absolutely stunned.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—No fighting; Cribb fell in making
play.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—This round odds fell again. Gregson
judged his distance well, and the first hit
threw in so tremendous a blow on the
temple, that Cribb was glaringly abroad and
stupefied. Had Gregson now possessed
science as a pugilist equal to his strength,
he must have beaten Cribb out of time, but
while Cribb was retreating to the ropes,
desirous of finishing the round, Gregson followed
him, and lost this glorious opportunity
of winning the battle, by idly sparring
away the time, instead of repeating his
blows. Cribb, with all his dexterity, was
obliged to sustain another disadvantageous
rally before he could close the round, and
then was knocked off his legs.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Cribb’s head cut a sorry figure, and
Gregson’s mouth and nose continued to
bleed copiously. They rallied, and both
exchanged hits to a stand-still, when Gregson
threw Cribb.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Gregson made play, but no dependance
could be placed on his hits, from the
bad judgment he displayed in his distances.
Cribb put in his favourite left-handed hit
again over Gregson’s dreadfully sore mouth.
Gregson, almost wild, closed, and threw
Cribb a severe cross-buttock. Nevertheless,
odds rose again two to one on Cribb.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Gregson showed evident distress.
Cribb still kept up his old game of retreating.
Gregson, impelled by the warmth of
his temper, followed him, and was severely
punished by some dreadful repeats on the
right side of his face. He fell on his knees,
and appeared unable to rise again alone.
(Three to one on Cribb.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Cribb supported his superiority. They
fought until both fell on their knees, and
after a fraternal hug, both laid themselves
down, exhausted with fatigue.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Both appeared distressed in their
wind, and showed great caution; closed, and
both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—In this round the combatants seemed
recovering, and a display of greater courage
never was seen. Gregson threw in a most
tremendous hit, but it fell short by an inch.
He then rallied, and successfully planted a
hit on the head, and another on the body.
Cribb seemed abroad, and Gregson threw
him. (Odds seven to four on Cribb.)</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Language would be incapable of
describing the dreadful appearance of the
faces of both combatants. They, however,
obstinately stood and exchanged hits until
Gregson fell, more by exhaustion than by
the force of the hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—This round was as resolutely contended.
Gregson exerted his utmost to gain
the advantage, but Cribb seemed to have
recovered both his wind and strength. Gregson
was so weak that his knees gave way,
and he fell on his hands, and actually pulled
at the grass with passion.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Cribb beat his opponent in this round
dreadfully. Gregson fell again; then tried
to get on his knees, but in vain.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—By chance Gregson struck Cribb on
the head at setting-to, and brought him
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—It appeared to require the greatest
exertions of both combatants to make any
impression, and he who for a minute was
favoured by nature had the advantage.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Both displayed excellent bottom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>They mutually ran in, met, and fell like men
perfectly inebriated.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—A rally, and Gregson bored down his
opponent. (Ten to one was offered that
Cribb did not come again.)</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Cribb at meeting had just strength
enough to put in two slight hits, and closed.
They wrestled, and Cribb threw Gregson,
who fell like lead. He was, however, put
again on his second’s knee, but on time
being called was unable to come forward,
having been seriously hurt in the last fall.
Cribb, on hearing the news might have considered
it the luckiest moment of his life:
he immediately fell into his second’s arms,
and remained apparently exhausted for some
minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'>On recovering, Cribb challenged Richmond,
who had offended him, to fight immediately
for 50 guineas, but this was prevented.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Gregson sustained in this
contest as much injury as he did with Gully,
and proved himself a bad judge of his distances,
and, as every scientific amateur
always considered him, a novice in the art
of pugilism. In rallying he had but one hit,
which, if it failed not only to take effect, but
to stun his adversary, the rally was sure to
terminate greatly to his disadvantage; still
Cribb never was secure of beating him, for
although hit several times to a stand-still,
he recovered his wind at intervals, and certainly
stood up with the most undaunted
courage. Cribb fought upon his old plan of
retreating, in order to wind his adversary,
and by this means always fights at home.
He was here particularly successful with his
left-handed hits, as Gregson’s face showed
by its dreadfully bruised state. Cribb’s
principal backer presented him with £150,
as a reward for his undaunted courage; and
Mr. Jackson kindly collected a handsome
subscription purse for the unfortunate Gregson.
Gregson was conveyed to the King’s
Head at Hampton, and Cribb to the Toy
Inn at Hampton Court. They were both
bled, and remained quiet until Wednesday
evening, when they returned to town. The
Duke of York, the Marquis of Tweeddale,
Lords Yarmouth, Craven, Brook, Barrymore,
and Somerville, with a large number
of military and naval officers and sporting
gentlemen were upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>This battle, which almost equalled in severity that between Gully and
Gregson, brought Cribb to the elevation of the championship, Mr. Gully
having, as we have seen, formally retired from the position. No sooner
did this come to the ears of Jem Belcher—who was still smarting under
the defeat he had sustained at the hands of Cribb, which he never ceased
maintaining was the result of an accident to his wrist—than he sent forth
a challenge to Cribb, for another trial for the belt and 200 guineas. Cribb
readily responded; the preliminaries were arranged, and Monday, February
1, 1809, fixed for the combat. Captain Barclay again came forward as
Cribb’s backer and trainer, and the odds were seven to four in Tom’s favour.
Belcher went into training at Virginia Water, and it was stated he was in
excellent condition and spirits.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the Monday above-mentioned, in a thirty feet roped ring, on Epsom
race-course, the men met, Belcher entering the enclosure at half past twelve,
waited upon by Dan Mendoza and Bob Clarke. Soon afterwards Cribb
threw his “castor” into the ring, followed by Joe Ward and Bill Gibbons.
Two and then three to one were offered on Cribb.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Sparring for half a minute,
Belcher made two hits; Cribb parried one,
but the other got home in the body. Cribb
returned; Belcher made a half-armed stop.
They closed, and Belcher fell, but lightly.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Cribb made play, and threw in a body
hit. Belcher rallied. Some good blows
exchanged, and Cribb threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—No visible marks of hitting yet. Belcher
very gay, with great skill made two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>lunging hits right and left, the last of which
Cribb received in full force under his left
ear, and a copious discharge of blood followed.
Some blows well exchanged at a
distance. Cribb threw Belcher again, but
manifestly had the worst of the round as to
hitting.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—A good display of science. Every hit
stopped on both sides. Cribb surprised the
amateurs by his steady stops and back-stops.
Belcher attempted to rally, but fell, seemingly
distressed in his wind.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Belcher put in right and left hits; but
it was evident that he had once more lamed
his right hand. Cribb again rallied successfully,
and threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Belcher retreated, seemingly to recruit
his wind, to the ropes, where Cribb
planted some good blows. Belcher now, in
order to avoid his adversary’s superior
strength, hit out, and successfully planted a
blow at arm’s length with his lame hand on
the spot he had before severely struck under
the ear, and which was also the precise place
in which Gregson put his tremendous blow
in their last contest. The blood again issued
with increased force; they closed, and Belcher
threw Cribb a cross-buttock. (Great
joy among the Bristol people. Cribb’s gluttony,
however, being well known, odds were
even now four to one in his favour.)</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—In this round Belcher indisputably had
the advantage, but his well-known infirmities
prevented his becoming the favourite. He
rallied, and hit with astonishing success.
The men closed, and Cribb fell easily.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Belcher appeared winded from his
exertions in the last round. He retreated
towards the ropes, where again he was reduced
to a courageous effort to extricate
himself. He rallied, put in a few hits, but
so slight, that Cribb appeared to be unconscious
of them. The men closed, hugged,
and contended for the fall, until both struggled
over the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—The combatants closed, and the seconds
separated them.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c009'><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Belcher had evidently great disadvantages
to labour under, and this round
indicated strongly in whose favour the contest
must terminate; Cribb had as yet made
little play. He now went in, hit, stopped,
and hit again five or six times successively,
and finally gave his opponent a heavy fall.
(Any odds, but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Cribb forced the fighting, as in the
preceding round, and again threw Belcher.
Both Belcher’s hands were now injured, and
Cribb kept the lead he had gained up to the</p>

<p class='c022'>19th.—Belcher now convinced the spectators
of his fine science. Unable to hit
effectively, he stopped Cribb’s blows with
marvellous neatness. Despite his dexterity,
however, Cribb now bored in and forced him
down; nevertheless, Belcher fought defensively,
prolonging the battle to the</p>

<p class='c022'>31st and final round.—It was piteous to
see this once renowned and brave champion
contending against nature. For the last ten
rounds there was not a chance of success;
still his olden skill made him difficult to
beat, and Cribb, slow and sure, never threw
away a chance. Belcher’s knuckles of his
right hand were swelled immensely, and his
right forearm covered with bruises from
stopping Cribb’s left hand. At the end of
forty minutes, at the urgent request of his
backers and friends, Belcher gave in, never
again to enter the field of honour.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Greatly as this victory adds
to the fame of the champion, as a resolute,
cautious, and truly brave boxer, the best
judges were agreed that had Belcher possessed
his once excellent constitution and
both his eyes, Cribb must have been defeated.
There were not wanting others who
maintained that, despite his slow hitting,
Cribb’s retreating and defensive tactics, with
his wonderful stamina, strength, and never-failing
courage, must make it a doubtful
point if Belcher ever could have thrashed
him, as Cribb always seemed to have a
“little left” when his adversary was on the
totter, and he was called upon “to finish.”
When Belcher first came from Bristol, he
was justly considered a phenomenon; under
the age of twenty he adduced a new system
of fighting, which completely baffled the
most scientific adepts in the old school, and
to him boxing in a great measure owed its
support, particularly by the emulation he
excited, and the attempts made to produce a
man to contend with him. But at this
period, at the age of only twenty-seven, he
was so far degenerated as to oppose, with
very little chance of success, any pugilist of
note; he was unable to make but very few
hits with his now enfeebled hands, and after
a contest of half an hour nature deserted him;
still he retained some of his former gaiety,
which only reminded those who knew him
what he once was, and every one, with an
eye of pity, saw that all powers of execution
had deserted him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cribb seemed now to have reached the topmost round of fortune’s ladder
as a pugilist. Like Alexander Selkirk he could exclaim,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My title there’s none to dispute,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>when a rival arose from an unexpected quarter. Tom Molineaux, an athletic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>American black, had astonished the amateurs by the wonderful strength and
gluttony he had shown in his conquest of Tom Blake (Tom Tough); indeed
his countryman, Bill Richmond, vaunted loudly that “the man of colour”
must win. Two hundred guineas was posted on behalf of Molineaux, and a
further purse of 100 guineas was subscribed by patrons of the ring to be
presented personally to the conqueror after the combat. Many persons were
astonished at the Nigger’s audacity, while others, who knew their man,
not only exhibited no surprise, but expressed their confidence that the
Darkey would prove the most formidable antagonist that Cribb had ever
encountered. Cribb was among those who held Molineaux very cheap, and
he expressed an opinion that he should win with ease. We read in a journal
of the day, “Some persons feel alarmed at the bare idea that a black man
and a foreigner should seize the championship of England, and decorate his
sable brow with the hard-earned laurels of Cribb. He must, however, have
his fair chance, though Tom swears that, for the honour of old England,
‘He’ll be d—— if he will relinquish a single sprig except with his life.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The affair excited the most extraordinary sensation, not only in the pugilistic
world, but also among classes who had hitherto considered boxing as
beneath their notice, and who now, thinking the honour of their country was
at stake, took a most lively interest in the affair. Although Cribb considered
that the conquest of such a beginner in the art as he supposed Molineaux to
be, would be mere child’s play, he was still wise enough not to throw a
chance away, and got himself into good condition, although he was, perhaps,
a little too fleshy. The betting upon the event was heavier than had been
known for many years. Odds were laid that Molineaux would be defeated
in fifteen minutes, and it was considered the excess of fool-hardiness in any
one who betted that he would stand more than half-an-hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand we find Molineaux was in the highest state of
confidence; indeed his vaunting bordered upon insolent braggadocia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day selected for this grand milling exhibition was December 18th,
1810, at Copthall Common, in the neighbourhood of East Grimstead, Sussex,
within thirty miles of the metropolis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the rain came down in torrents, and the <em>distance</em> from
London (hear this ye railroad travellers of 1879!), the Fancy were not to be
deterred from witnessing the mill, and waded through a clayey road, nearly
knee-deep for five miles, with alacrity and cheerfulness, so great was the
curiosity and interest manifested upon this battle. We shall, according
to our arrangement, where practicable, give the original report, vice the
written-up rhodomontade of “Boxiana,” copied servilely by later publications.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>At twelve o’clock, Mr. Jackson, who generally officiates as master of the
ceremonies, formed an outer circle of the various vehicles which had transported
so many thousands from the metropolis, at the foot of a hill, in order
to shield the combatants as much as possible from the chilling rain and wind
from the eastward. A twenty-four feet ring, according to preceding arrangement,
was constructed within this circle, with stakes and ropes, and as soon
as completed Molineaux came forward, bowed to all around, hurled up his
cap in defiance, and then withdrew to strip. Cribb followed his example,
and both soon returned eager for the fray, amid the plaudits of the populace,
whose animated countenances seemed to express the passing thought, “What
a glorious thing’s a battle.” Gully and Joe Ward seconded Cribb; and
Richmond and Jones officiated for Molineaux.</p>

<p class='c007'>On stripping, the appearance of the men was really formidable; Cribb,
who stood five feet ten inches and a half, weighed fourteen stone three
pounds, while Molineaux, who was five feet eight inches and a quarter, was
only a pound lighter, and consequently looked far more muscular. His arms
were of wondrous length and roundness of form. He looked confident and
fierce, rather than smiling, and nodded his head as he shook hands.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The combatants shook hands,
retired two steps, put themselves in attitude,
eyeing each other with the most penetrating
looks, and each highly attentive to his
guard. For a moment a solemn pause ensued.
A little sparring, and Molineaux put
in the first hit by a right-handed body-blow
on the left side of his opponent. Cribb
smartly returned right and left on the head,
and one for luck on the body. Molineaux
closed, and Cribb threw him. Thus the
round ended without bloodshed.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Both set-to with great eagerness,
apparently fully determined on a manly
stand-up fight, seeming to exclude sparring
and shifting altogether. A furious rally,
heavy blows exchanged. Cribb’s did most
execution, being thrown in straight forward,
while Molineaux struck hand over head with
most astonishing power, but little judgment,
and Cribb either parried or spoilt the effort,
by planting the first hit. Cribb, although
he showed first blood by a cut on the lip,
evidently had the best of the round.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Molineaux faced his antagonist with
great courage. Cribb met him with equal
resolution, and after a little sparring brought
his left fist in contact with his antagonist’s
head at arm’s length with such tremendous
force, that he laid him to measure his full
length on the earth. (Four to one on Cribb.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Molineaux immediately jumped on his
legs, and commenced a desperate rally, in
which Cribb again brought him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—An excellent round, good straight-forward
fighting, and both rallied in great
style. Molineaux tried to bore down his
opponent by main strength; Cribb determined
to prevent him if possible, by repeating
some desperate blows on the head. They
closed, and Molineaux fibbed very dexterously
in Dutch Sam’s style, but at length
fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Molineaux commenced furiously. Cribb
slipped, but partially recovered, and by a
blow brought down Molineaux.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Molineaux rushed in as before, and
Cribb put in a violent blow on the forehead,
by which he picked up a handsome “rainbow.”
His countenance was, however, not
the more clouded, and he was first to the
time.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Both combatants by this time had
been taught discrimination, and had discovered
each other’s physical powers. Cribb
found out that his notion of beating Molineaux
off hand was truly fallacious, as he
really was an ugly customer, and he also became
sensible that if Molineaux could so reduce
him as to make his sledge hammer hits
tell, he should not willingly lay his head for
the anvil. He therefore now brought forward
his science, and began to adopt his usual
famous retreating system. The men rallied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>desperately; success was alternate. At
length Molineaux fell; but Cribb, from his
violent exertion, appeared weaker than his
opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Gallantly contested. Cribb made play.
Molineaux followed courageously, giving no
quarter, put in a severe hit, and Cribb fell,
evidently much exhausted. The knowing
ones looked queer; Cribb had been fighting
too fast.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—The conceit by this time was tolerably
well taken out of both combatants; their
heads and faces were hideously disfigured.
Molineaux again displayed superiority of
strength. For full two minutes hits were
exchanged greatly to the disadvantage of
Cribb; he, however, at length brought down
his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Courageously contested. Molineaux
brought Cribb down.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Cribb put in a severe hit in the body.
Molineaux returned on the head and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Cribb still continued his shy plan,
and Molineaux evidently had the advantage.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c009'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>23.—In this round Cribb perceiving Molineaux
falling off, made play and brought
him down, the first time for several rounds.</p>

<p class='c022'>24 to 28.—Bets considerably reduced.
They had been four to one on Molineaux,
but were now even.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—Molineaux ineffectually endeavoured
to get Cribb’s head under his left arm, and
also to throw him, but failed in both. The
men rallied, and Cribb, who now appeared
to possess more confidence than he had for
some rounds, knocked his opponent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—Cribb now again got the lead, and
stuck up to his opponent until he fairly
rallied him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—A short rally. Molineaux threw
Cribb, but in the struggle fell over him and
pitched upon his head, which so severely
affected him that he could hardly stand.
Richmond, however, prompted him to go
on, in hopes of Cribb being exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—Molineaux fell by an effort to keep
his legs. This by Cribb’s party was called
falling without a blow, and a squabble would
have ensued, had not Molineaux exclaimed,
“I can fight no more.”</p>

<p class='c022'>Cribb was greatly elated at such a sound,
but was too weak to throw his usual somersault.
The contest lasted fifty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Molineaux in this contest
proved himself as courageous a man as ever
an adversary contended with, and Cribb’s
merits as a pugilist cannot but be enhanced
by a victory over so tremendous an opponent.
The Black astonished every one, not only by
his extraordinary power of hitting, and his
gigantic strength, but also by his acquaintance
with the science, which was far greater
than any one had given him credit for.
In the 28th round, after the men were
carried to their corners, Cribb was so much
exhausted that he could hardly rise from his
second’s knee at the call of “Time,” which
was uttered loudly by Sir Thomas Apreece,
one of the umpires. Joe Ward, his second,
by a little manœuvring, occupied the attention
of the Black’s seconds, and so managed
to prolong the period sufficiently to enable
the champion to recover a little, and thus
assisted him to pull through.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following appeared in the papers of the ensuing week:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—My friends think that had the weather on last Tuesday, the day on which I contended

<p class='c018'>“As it is possible this letter may meet the public eye, I cannot omit the opportunity of

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>On Tuesday, January 29th, Cribb took a benefit at the Fives Court, at
which nearly 3000 persons were present. Cribb and Tom Belcher, Molineaux
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>and Richmond, Firby, Power, Ben Burn, Cropley, Tom O’Donnell, Rimmer,<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c009'><sup>[136]</sup></a>
a young big one brought forward by Gregson, set-to.</p>

<p class='c007'>Molineaux’s second fight with Cribb, was postponed by the intervention
of Rimmer’s challenge, as Richmond thought it a safer match. Molineaux,
having disposed of the big Lancashire man’s pretensions, the opinion of many
of the public was evidently shared by Molineaux, who pleaded that, in
addition to the above circumstance, the weather had proved unpropitious,
and had more effect upon his constitution—which was little acclimated to
cold and wet—than upon the more hardy frame of Cribb, the latter could
not decline giving his opponent a chance to retrieve his laurels. A match was
accordingly made for £300 a-side, and on Saturday, September 28th, 1811,
was brought to issue at Thistleton Gap, in the parish of Wymondham, in
the county of Leicester, very near Crown Point, the spot where the three
counties, Lincoln, Leicester, and Rutland unite. This match created, if
possible, more interest than that which had preceded it, and for twenty miles
round the scene of action not a bed was to be obtained for love or money the
previous night, unless bespoken days beforehand. By six o’clock in the
morning, hundreds were astir in order to get good places near the stage which
had been erected, and by the time the men arrived there were about 20,000
persons present, including many Corinthians of the highest rank. Neither
man on this occasion weighed so much, by nearly a stone, as in the former
fight. Captain Barclay had trained Cribb on a system peculiar to himself,
and had reduced him to thirteen stone six pounds, and still kept his stamina
unimpaired. The men mounted the stage at twelve o’clock, Cribb being the
first to show, and both were greeted with loud applause. A twenty-five feet
stage was erected in a stubble ground without the slightest interruption.
Cribb’s second was his old friend and intimate companion Gully, and Joe
Ward bottle-holder; Bill Richmond and Bill Gibbons officiated for Molineaux.
At eighteen minutes after twelve they set-to; betting three to one on Cribb,
and six to four in his favour for the first knock-down blow.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Sparring for about a minute,
when Cribb made play right and left. The
right-handed blow told slightly in the body
of Molineaux, who returned slightly on the
head; a rally now ensued, they exchanged
their blows, when Molineaux fell from a
dexterous hit in the throat; the blows, however,
throughout this round were not at a
distance to do very great execution. Betting
unaltered.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Cribb showed first blood at the mouth
at setting-to. A dreadful rally commenced.
Cribb put in a good body hit with the right
hand, which Molineaux returned on the
head with the left flush; both combatants
now fought at half-arm, and exchanged some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>half dozen hits with great force. They then
closed, and after a severe trial of strength
Molineaux threw his opponent. Odds six to
four on Cribb.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—In the last rally Cribb’s right eye
was nearly closed, and now another equally
sanguinary followed. After sparring for
wind, in which essential Molineaux was
evidently deficient, Cribb put in a dreadful
“doubler” on the body of his opponent, who,
although hit away, kept his legs and renewed
the rally with such ferocity, that the backers
of the odds looked blue. The rally lasted
a minute and a half, when the combatants
closed, and Molineaux again threw Cribb
with astonishing force. Odds fell, but Cribb’s
tried game still kept him the favourite.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—In the rally Cribb had hit right and
left at the body and head, but Molineaux
fought at the head only. He was so successful
with the left hand, that he planted many
flush hits. Both Cribb’s eyes were now
damaged, his face dreadfully disfigured, and
he bled profusely. Molineaux evidently was
in great distress, his chest and sides heaving
fearfully. Cribb smiled at such a favourable
omen, and renewed the rally with a heroism,
perhaps, never excelled, and in point of
judgment most adroitly timed. Hits in
abundance were exchanged, Cribb still
fighting at the “mark,” and Molineaux at
the head; at length Cribb fell, evincing
great exhaustion. Odds however were now
seven to four in his favour.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Molineaux accepted the rally, and the
execution on both sides was truly terrific.
Molineaux had the best of the exchanges,
and Cribb fell from a blow and in falling
received another. This excited some murmurs
and applause from the partisans of the
contending heroes, and on reference to the
umpires was decided “fair,” Cribb’s hands
being at liberty, and not having yet touched
the floor.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Molineaux distressed for wind and
exhausted, lunged right and left. Cribb
avoided his blows, and then put in a good
hit with his right, which Molineaux stopped
exceedingly well. Cribb now got in a destructive
blow at his “mark,” which doubled
up Molineaux; he got away pitifully cut
up: he, however, returned to begin a rally,
seemingly anxious to go in, but still sensible
of the ugly consequences. He appeared
almost frantic, and no dancing-master could
have performed a pirouette more gratifying
to Cribb’s friends. Molineaux hit short,
capered about, and was quite abroad. Cribb
followed him round the ring, and after some
astonishing execution, floored him by a
tremendous hit at full arm’s length. The
odds rose five to one.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Molineaux seemed lost in rage. He
ran in, and undoubtedly did some execution;
but Cribb put in several straight hits about
the throat, stepping back after each. Molineaux
bored in till he fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Molineaux again rallied, seemingly as
a forlorn hope, but his distance was ill-judged.
Cribb once and again nobbed him,
and getting his head (his own trick by the
bye) under his left arm, fibbed him until
he fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Lombard Street to a China orange.
Molineaux was dead beat, and only stood up
to encounter Cribb’s ponderous blows. He
ran in, Cribb met him with his left hand;
the blow was tremendous, being doubled in
force by the black’s impetuous rush, Molineaux’s
jaw was fractured, and he fell like a
log. He did not come to time within the
half minute, but Cribb, wishing to show his
superiority, gave away this chance, dancing
a hornpipe about the stage, until—</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—With great difficulty Molineaux got
off his second’s knee, only for fresh punishment.
His rush was desperate, but equally
unsuccessful, and he fell evidently from
distress.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Here ended the contest. Cribb gave
away another chance in the time. Molineaux’s
senses, however, were absolutely hit
out of him; he was perfectly unable to stand,
and a Scotch reel by Gully and Cribb
announced the victory, while the very welkin
echoed with applause.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span><a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c009'><sup>[137]</sup></a>—This battle, which lasted only
nineteen minutes ten seconds, left no doubt
as to the superiority of Cribb. The science
of Molineaux at the opening of the fight was
quite equal to that of the champion, but the
condition of Cribb was far better, his temper
more under restraint, and although there
was no question of Molineaux’s courage,
which almost amounted to ferocity, Cribb
was his superior in steadiness and self-possession.
During the battle the spectators
gave applause to both combatants, and many
were surprised that Molineaux should have
found himself necessitated to relinquish the
palm in so short a time, when he so obstinately
contested with the same opponent
thrice the duration so very recently. It is
to be considered, that in the first combat
Cribb was full of flesh, and by no means in
prime condition; and again, that in this
battle, although Molineaux had acquired an
increased degree of science, he had by his
own conduct impaired his stamina. Although
it has been acknowledged that applause was
mutually given, and that Molineaux in every
point had fair play shown him, it cannot but
be granted that the exulting clamour of congratulation,
proceeding from the Champion’s
friends, when even the slightest advantage
seemed to favour him, must have tended to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>hurt the feelings of the man of colour, and
very probably to have cowed him. It should
have been considered that Molineaux was a
stranger, that he stood indisputably a man of
courage; that he came to the contest unprotected
and unsupported by friends of note;
while his opponent commanded the patronage
of the leading men as well as the natural
partiality of his countrymen in his favour.
Much has been said of Molineaux’s savage
denunciations against Cribb; of his vapouring
professions of what he should like to do to
him; and these were thought sufficiently
disgusting to have excited animosity against
him. But granting that Molineaux was
brutish enough to make use of many of the
barbarous expressions imputed to him, we
certainly ought to take into consideration
the circumstances under which they were
uttered. The black could not but be sensible
that Cribb was better supported by his many
surrounding friends than himself. He knew
and felt that Cribb was under the care of
the first trainer in the country, while he was
left to the government of Tom Belcher and
Richmond, who made him an instrument of
getting money, by carrying him round the
country to exhibit sparring, and, to keep
him in good temper and pliable to their
wishes, allowing him to drink stout and ale
by gallons. It is said that on the morning
of the fight, he bolted a boiled fowl, an
apple pie, and a tankard of porter for his
breakfast. When all these circumstances
are considered, by an unprejudiced mind, it
cannot be denied, that whatever national
pride we may justly feel in our Champion’s
triumph, and admiration of his pluck and
manly prowess, we cannot but admit that
the man of colour was a formidable antagonist,
and one who, but for his own imprudence,
might have won fame and fortune
in the pugilistic arena.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c009'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c022'>The stage, which was twenty-five feet
square, was erected in a stubble field, surrounded
first by a roped ring, in order to
prevent any interruption by the crowd, and
secondly, by as well framed and supported
a circle of pedestrians as perhaps was ever
witnessed, notwithstanding the great distance
from the metropolis. The first row of these,
as usual upon most occasions, lying down,
the second kneeling, and the rest standing
up. Outside these again were numerous
horsemen, some seated, while others more
eager stood, circus-like, upon their saddle;
these were intermixed with every description
of carriage, gig, barouche, buggy, cart, and
waggon. The display of sporting men, from
the peer on the box of his four-in-hand to
the rustic in clouted shoes, but as perfect
a picture as the fancy can well conceive.
Every fighting man of note, every pugilistic
amateur was to be seen, and among those
active and peculiarly interested we noted
Lord Yarmouth, the Hon. Berkeley Craven,
Major Mellish, Captain Barclay (Allardyce
of Ury),<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c009'><sup>[139]</sup></a> Sir Francis Bayntun, General
Grosvenor, Thomas Goddard, Esq., Sir
Henry Smith, the Marquis of Queensberry,
Lord Pomfret, Sir Charles Astor, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the Sunday after the battle the champion passed through Stamford in
a barouche and four, the horses decorated with blue ribbons (Cribb’s colours).
He called on Molineaux at Grantham, and on the Monday arrived in London,
where he was received with a public ovation, the wide street at Holborn
being almost impassable from the crowds which assembled to greet the
Champion of England. At the Horse and Dolphin,<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c009'><sup>[140]</sup></a> St. Martin’s Street,
Richmond’s house, on the Saturday night, the crowd was so immense that a
posse of officers attended and the house was closed. Cribb’s passage home to
his house, in White Lion Street, Seven Dials, was through so dense an
assemblage of applauding spectators that the streets were almost impassable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>We read in “Boxiana,” that “Cribb gained £400 by this set-to, and his
patron, Captain Barclay, £10,000; a baker, in the Borough, sported all his
blunt, personal property, together with the lease of his house, etc., amounting
to £1,700, upon the Champion. A curious bet was also made between
two sporting characters, the winner to get a complete suit of clothes, shirt,
cravat, etc., etc., with walking stick, gloves, and a guinea in the trousers
pocket. Through the kind interference of Mr. Jackson, a collection of nearly
£50 was made for Molineaux.” We have already referred to the superior
condition of Cribb in this second battle, and the present appears a fitting
place to narrate a few circumstances relating to this remarkable instance
of the first recorded results of the modern system of training. It is extracted
from a little work on “Pedestrianism and Training,” published in 1816,
“revised” by Captain Barclay himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Champion arrived at Ury on the 7th of July of that year. He
weighed sixteen stone; and from his mode of living in London, and the
confinement of a crowded city, he had become corpulent, big-bellied, full
of gross humours, and short-breathed; and it was with difficulty he could
walk ten miles. He first went through a course of physic, which consisted
of three doses; but for two weeks he walked about as he pleased, and
generally traversed the woods and plantations with a fowling-piece in his
hand; the reports of his gun resounded every where through the groves
and the hollows of that delightful place, to the great terror of the magpies
and wood pigeons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After amusing himself in this way for about a fortnight, he then commenced
his regular walking exercise, which at first was about ten or twelve
miles a day. It was soon after increased to eighteen or twenty; and he ran
regularly, morning and evening, a quarter of a mile at the top of his speed.
In consequence of his physic and exercise, his weight was reduced, in the
course of five weeks, from sixteen stone to fourteen and nine pounds. At
this period he commenced his sweats, and took three during the month he
remained at Ury afterwards; and his weight was gradually reduced to thirteen
stone and five pounds, which was ascertained to be his pitch of condition,
as he would not reduce farther without weakening.</p>

<p class='c007'>“During the course of his training, the Champion went twice to the Highlands,
and took strong exercise. He walked to Mar Lodge, which is about
sixty miles distant from Ury, where he arrived to dinner on the second day,
being now able to go thirty miles a day with ease, and probably he could
have walked twice as far if it had been necessary. He remained in the
Highlands about a week each time, and amused himself with shooting. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>principal advantage which he derived from these expeditions was the severe
exercise he was obliged to undergo in following Captain Barclay. He
improved more in strength and wind by his journeys to the Highlands than
by any other part of the training process.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His diet and drink were the same as used in the pedestrian regimen, and
in other respects, the rules previously laid down were generally applied to
him. That he was brought to his ultimate pitch of condition was evident,
from the high state of health and strength in which he appeared when
he mounted the stage to contend with Molineaux, who has since confessed
that when he saw his fine condition, he totally despaired of gaining the
battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cribb was altogether about eleven weeks under training, but he remained
only nine weeks at Ury. Besides his regular exercise, he was occasionally
employed in sparring at Stonehaven, where he gave lessons in the pugilistic
art. He was not allowed much rest, but was constantly occupied in some
active employment. He enjoyed good spirits, being at the time fully convinced
that he should beat his antagonist. He was managed, however, with
great address, and the result corresponded with the wishes of his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would be perhaps improper, while speaking of Cribb, to omit mentioning
that, during his residence in the north of Scotland, he conducted himself
in all respects with much propriety. He showed traits of a feeling, humane,
and charitable disposition, on various occasions. While walking along
Union Street in Aberdeen, he was accosted by a woman apparently in great
distress. Her story affected him, and the emotions of his heart became
evident in the muscles of his face. He gave her all the silver he had in his
pocket. ‘God bless your honour,’ she said, ‘ye’are surely not an or’nary
mon!’ This circumstance is mentioned with the more pleasure, as it affords
one instance, at least, in opposition to the mistaken opinion that professional
pugilists are ferocious, and totally destitute of the better propensities of mankind.
The illustrious Mr. Windham, entertained juster sentiments of the
pugilistic art, as evinced by a print he presented to Mr. Jackson as a mark
of his esteem. In one compartment an Italian, darting his stiletto at his
victim, is represented; and in the other, the combat of two Englishmen in
the ring. For this celebrated genius was always of opinion, that nothing
tended more to preserve among the English peasantry those sentiments of
good faith and honour, which have ever distinguished them from the natives
of Italy and Spain, than the frequent practice of fair and open boxing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after Cribb’s final triumph, in honour of his hard-earned victories,
a splendid dinner was given at Gregson’s (the Castle, Holborn), by a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>party of the Champion’s admirers and patrons. Cribb was unanimously
called to the chair. His conduct as president was unassuming and pleasant,
receiving the approbation of the patrons of distinction by whom he was surrounded.
Harmony prevailed, and several excellent songs written for the
occasion, full of point, were most rapturously received, particularly one of
Bob Gregson’s, which was applauded to the echo, and loudly encored. The
company did not depart till they unanimously voted the Champion a silver
cup, valued 50 guineas, as a memorial of the high opinion which the sporting
world held of his uniform courage in his pugilistic combats; also for his
having voluntarily entered the ring (after positively declining pugilism in
general), on the score of nationality, his own individual fame, and to prevent
a foreigner from triumphing over the heroes of England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subscriptions for this purpose proving ample, the sum was increased,
and a silver cup of 80 guineas value was presented to the Champion at the
Castle Tavern, Holborn, on Monday, the 2nd of December, 1811, at a dinner
appointed for that purpose, Tom Cribb in the chair, supported by one of the
most numerous and respectable assemblages of the “fancy” ever witnessed.
After the cloth was removed, and the usual loyal toasts given, Mr. Emery
(of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden), who had at a previous meeting been
unanimously voted to present the plate, was now called upon to fulfil the
wishes of the company. The cup was produced, the son of Thespis rose, and
after drinking to “Cribb, the Champion of England!” addressed the chairman
to the following effect:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thomas Cribb, I have the honour this day of being the representative of
a numerous and respectable body of your friends; and though I am by no
means qualified to attempt the undertaking which has devolved on me by a
vote of the subscribers, yet the cause will, I am confident, prove a sufficient
excuse for my want of ability. You are requested to accept this cup as a
tribute of respect, for the uniform valour and integrity you have shown in
your several combats, but most particularly for the additional proofs of native
skill and manly intrepidity displayed by your last memorable battle, when
the cause rested, not merely upon individual fame, but for the pugilistic
reputation of your country, in contending with a formidable foreign antagonist.
In that combat you gave proof that the hand of a foreigner, when
lifted against a son of Britannia, must not only be aided by the strength of a
lion, but the heart also.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fame you have so well earned has been by manly and upright conduct;
and such conduct, I have no doubt, will ever mark your very creditable
retirement from the ring, or stage of pugilism. However intoxicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>the cup or its contents may at any future period make you, I am sufficiently
persuaded the gentlemen present, and the sons of John Bull in general, will
never consider you have a cup too much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The cup, filled with wine, having gone round, the Champion thus briefly
addressed his patrons:—“Gentlemen, for the honour you have done me in
presenting this cup, I most respectfully beg of you to accept my warmest
thanks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Harmony reigned throughout, and the Champion, impressed with gratitude
to his leading patrons, Sir Henry Smyth, Bart., Captain Barclay, Thirlwall
Harrison, Esq., etc., drank their healths with marked animation and respect;
and the cup, in being put round, upon its arrival into the hands of Mr. Jackson,
Gully, Gregson, and the veteran Joe Ward (who acted as vice), the
company, as a mark of esteem for their past services, loudly cheered those
heroes of the fist.</p>

<p class='c007'>After an unsuccessful venture as a coal-merchant, at Hungerford Wharf,
Cribb underwent the usual metamorphosis from a pugilist to a publican, and
opened a house at the Golden Lion in the Borough; but finding his position
too far eastward for his numerous aristocratic patrons, “honest Tom” moved
his quarters to the King’s Arms,<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c009'><sup>[141]</sup></a> the corner of Duke Street and King Street,
St. James’s, and subsequently to the Union Arms, at the corner of Panton
Street and Oxendon Street, Haymarket.</p>

<p class='c007'>With one interruption, presently to be noticed, our hero’s life was henceforth
of a peaceful character. In 1814, upon the conclusion of the gigantic
European struggle with the first Napoleon, Cribb had the honour of sparring
before the monarchs, princes, and marshals, who visited the Prince Regent in
honour of the pacification of Europe. On Wednesday, June 15, 1814, the
Emperor of Russia, the Hetman Platoff, Marshal Blucher, and an illustrious
party, assembled at the house of Lord Lowther, in Pall Mall, to an elegant
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</span></i>, when boxing, as a peculiar trait of the brave nation of England,
was introduced. “The distinguished visitors were so much gratified with
this generous mode of settling quarrels, and the scientific mode of attack and
defence exhibited, that they requested of Lord Lowther that another trial of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>skill might take place on the Friday following, when, in addition to the
visitors, the King of Prussia, the Prince Royal of Prussia, Princes Frederick
and William of Prussia, the Prince of Mecklenburg, General D’Yorck, etc.,
honoured the meeting with their presence. Some elegant specimens of the
pugilistic art were displayed between Messrs. Jackson, Belcher, Cribb, Richmond,
Painter, Oliver, etc. The set-tos in general were excellent; but the
sparring of Jackson was particularly admired. The Champion of England
(Cribb) occasioned a general stare among the spectators, and the veteran
Blucher eyed him with more than common attention. The royal guests
expressed their satisfaction at the treat they had experienced; and upon
taking their departure, complimented his lordship as the patron of so manly
and characteristic a trait of his country.”</p>

<p class='c007'>About this period, and for several years, Tom’s character and doings seem
to have been a favourite theme with “penny-a-liners” and paragraph writers,
and the papers of the time, furnish a crop of anecdotes, good, bad, and indifferent,
many of which are scattered up and down Pierce Egan’s volumes.
We give a few of them on his authority.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tom Cribb and the Pig.</span>—During the time Tom was in training, previous
to his match with Gregson, as he was taking his morning’s exercise
through a country village, accompanied by his friend Gully, dressed in long
smock frocks, they observed an overgrown fellow beating a pig in a very
cruel manner. Upon inquiry, they found the animal belonged to a neighbour,
and civilly begged him to desist from such cruelty. The fellow abused
them for their interfering, and, relying on his strength, threatened to give
them both a good hiding, assisted by three or four hawbucks, who had
joined the squabble. Without farther ceremony the fellow put himself in an
offensive attitude, and made a violent blow at Cribb, which the latter stopped
with the utmost <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>, not forgetting to put in his one-two tremendously,
the effects of which floored this unfeeling brute in a twinkling. His
nob was materially shook, and the claret tapped in a masterly style. This
small taste of Cribb’s quality had the desired effect. The fight was instantly
taken out of the chaw-bacon, who went off, growling to himself, from the
scene of his cruelty and impertinence; but not, however, before receiving
an admonition from the Champion to be more temperate in his language and
humane in his conduct in future. Gully, smiling to himself, now wished
another of these Johnny Raws, who had been also very busy and impudent,
to try what he could do with him, observing, that he might have better luck
than his fellow servant. But in vain, the milling specimen exhibited by
Cribb had completely terrified all their boasted valour into submission. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>was soon afterwards learned in the village that the row in question had been
with Gully and Cribb.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cribb and the Navvy.</span>—A navigator, from Lancashire, as big and as
rough an article as can be imagined, prompted, it is supposed, by the great
pugilistic success of Carter, took a turn, on Thursday evening, November 7,
1816, in the neighbourhood of Westminster, and suddenly pounced on the
Champion of England and Tom Oliver, in the friendly act of blowing a cloud
together. Without waiting for the formality of an introduction to those
heroes of the fist, he boasted of his milling pretensions, and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cérémonie</span></i>,
challenged Oliver for a turn-up. The coat of Oliver was half way off to
resent this unprovoked attack upon his prowess, but Cribb forbade it, observing
that the navigator was too heavy, and that he should be more fitted to
accommodate this hasty customer, having no doubt but that he should quickly
alter his opinion of his own capabilities. The parties retired to a large shed
at the back of the house, when a turn-up commenced without further delay.
The navigator run in like a bull, head foremost, and endeavoured to bring
the Champion down after the Lancashire method, by seizing hold of his
thighs; but he failed in his attempts most wofully, for in five minutes he
was so punished that he cried out, “I yeald.” Cribb left him to reflect on
his folly, but in the course of a few minutes he came in and again insisted
upon having another set-to with “the stout ’un.” This was agreed to, but
the navigator soon adopted his former phrase of “I yeald!” Cribb now
retired, supposing he had given complete satisfaction; but it was not long
before he was compelled to renew the combat for the third time with this
dissatisfied brute. The navigator resorted to purring, and endeavoured to
effect a conquest by hugging; but Cribb clareted him in all directions, and
marked his body so severely, that he now could scarcely articulate the provincial,
“I yeald!” The only regret expressed by the Champion was that,
during an attack of twenty minutes, he could not put in a straight blow, as
the navigator never stood up like a man, merely attempting by foul means to
throw or disable his man. Cribb returned home without a scratch, while
the man of mud received an important lesson on the advantages of science.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Champion and the Jew.</span>—The placid and forbearing character of Cribb
is strikingly illustrated in the following incident. Cribb, in passing through
Fore Street, Cripplegate, was most grossly insulted by a Jew of the name of
Simmonds, who, valuing himself upon his manhood, and not knowing whom
he was in contact with, endeavoured to give our hero a facer. The Champion,
with the utmost composure, seized hold of this mere apology for a boxer (in
his hands), yet disdained to inflict that sort of punishment which, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>he given way to passion, from his well-known strength and science, must in
all probability nearly annihilated this presuming Israelite. Instead of this,
however, Tom instantly compelled Mordecai to go before the Lord Mayor to
answer for the assault. His Lordship, on hearing the case, was struck with
the magnanimity displayed by Cribb on this occasion, and highly praised
him for his manliness of temper, at the same time reprimanding the Jew
severely for his improper behaviour. The Jew was, however, discharged on
paying the costs, upon the Champion good-naturedly interposing to prevent a
fine.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Cribb and Massa Kendrick.</span>—A sable hero, well known in the fancy
circles as Massa Kendrick, was brought before Mr. Birnie, at Bow Street, on
a Bench warrant, for an assault on the Champion of England. The African
kicked most confoundedly at finding himself in the grasp of the law. When
told by the magistrate that he must find good and sufficient bail, he exclaimed,
“Bail! what ‘casion for bail? Massa Cribb the most quarrelsomest
man in all England. He’s a fighting man, and I’m a fighting man, and if I
gibs him punch ob the head, and he gib me another, what that to anumbody
else? What the use ob talking about bail?” In reply to this tirade the
Champion calmly observed, “If I was not to take such a step as this now and
then, I could not carry on my business, or even live in my own house, for
these swaggering blackguards.” He then explained to the magistrate that
the defendant was noisy and riotous in his house, and in consequence he
insisted on his leaving; but, instead of doing so, he seized the Champion by
the cravat, and attempted to extinguish his glories by strangulation, at the
same time placing his hand under his thigh, apparently with the intention of
throwing him. “But,” said the Champion, “that was all my eye, for I put
him down.” Kendrick was about to retort, but the magistrate stopped his
mouth, by ordering him to find the required bail.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Champion and his Dwarf.</span>—To these proofs of courage and forbearance
we will append a sample or two of his humanity, an unfailing accompaniment
of true valour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our hero made his bow before the magistrate on Wednesday, December 18,
1822, as the friend and protector of the helpless, in the person of a German
dwarf, named John Hauptman. This little fellow, whose extreme altitude
was forty inches, obtained a living during many years by hiring himself out
as an exhibition to itinerant showmen. But his day had gone by—other
and more youthful dwarfs had superseded him in the public favour, and
poverty was pressing heavily on his head, when, in the midst of his destitution,
accident led him to the hospitable fireside of Tom Cribb. The Champion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>listened to his tale of poverty; cheered his frame with the comforts of his
bar and his larder, and told him he was welcome to stay at the Union Arms
till he could find a better shelter, and he resided there as a sort of assistant
waiter.</p>

<p class='c007'>A drunken hackney-coach master, named Beckett, during the champion’s
absence, on the previous Monday, not only insulted the little fellow, but
encouraged his son, a lad of about ten years old, to beat him, and for this
outrage on his protégé, the Champion now sought redress.</p>

<p class='c007'>The burly-built hero of the ring entered the office, leading his tiny friend
by the hand; and he and the lad having been placed side by side on a stool
before the bench, the Champion stated what he had heard of the transaction,
adding, “The poor little fellow has no friend in the world but me, your
worship, and hang me if I would not rather have been beat myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That would not have been so easy a matter, Mr. Cribb,” observed his
worship, and directed the dwarf to be sworn.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little fellow then gave a very humble and modest account of the affair.
He said, in tolerable English, that he was very sorry anybody should be
troubled on his account, but Mr. Beckett would not be satisfied unless he
would fight with the boy, and because he would not fight, he urged the boy
on, till he knocked him down by “a blow on de mout, which cut him vor
mush, and hurt him a mush deal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lad pulled out his torn shirt-frill in reply, and the father delivered
his defence thus:—“It was the brandy and water that did it, your worship;
I’ll tell the truth: it was the brandy and water sure enough. I have known
Mr. Cribb many years.” “That’s the reason you ought not to have taken
advantage of my absence, to insult a poor little fellow you know I cared so
much for,” observed the kind-hearted Champion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The magistrate, after having warmly commended the conduct of the
Champion, directed the hackneyman to find bail for the assault. Upon
retiring to settle the row, the dragsman made it “all right” with Cribb, by
making the dwarf a present of a sovereign.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the Fives Court, on the occasion of Scroggins’s benefit, March 23, 1817,
Jack Carter, who then aspired to the championship, which for nearly eight
years had remained undisputed in the hands of Cribb, made his appearance
upon the stage, and a glove being thrown up as a defiance, the Champion of
England presented himself, to answer the challenge. However, upon Gregson
ascending the platform to spar, Cribb was about to retire, when “Cribb,
Cribb!” was vociferated from all parts of the court. The anxiety was so
great, that the disturbance was hardly appeased until Cribb appeared ready
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>for the combat. Cribb looked well and kept his position like a rock. He
could neither be drawn nor stepped in upon, and the skirmishing tactics
of the Lancashire hero could make no impression on the veteran of the ring.
At in-fighting Cribb also decidedly took the lead. Carter put in one or two
facers with much dexterity; but upon the milling system the Black Diamond
proved that he was still a diamond, and instead of losing any of his former
brilliancy, he shone with increased lustre and effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From this period,” says “Boxiana,” “Carter seems to have ‘fancied’
a shy at Cribb, and on his return from Ireland on Tuesday, February 1,
1820, he challenged the man of colour, Sutton, for 100 guineas a-side.
While this match was on, Carter called in at a sporting house, at the west
end of the town; and, in consequence of his not being admitted into a private
party, then assembled, he intemperately addressed a note to the chairman as
‘Mr. Swell.’ He was, however, admitted, when he had the bad taste to
begin flourishing about his repeated conquests over the dark part of the
creation. He also sneered at the Champion, saying, he had left off fighting,
because fighting had left him off; but he (Carter) had come to fight somebody,
and indeed he would fight ‘onybody!’ This sort of chaffing was
attempted to be checked by a person present, when the Lancashire brute,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans ceremonie</span></i>, threw the contents of a glass of wine in his face, part of which
alighted on Tom Cribb. This insult was not to be borne, and the champion
of England exclaimed “it was wrong!” Carter hereon defied him. Little
parley ensued, ere the lion of the ring, although rather worse for the juice of
the grape, grappled his enemy. He held up the Lancashire hero with the
utmost ease, with one hand, in the Randall style, and Carter’s frontispiece
received such repeated quiltings from the fist of Cribb that it was like a
fashionable footman paying away at a knocker. It was close quarters—in
fact, yard-arm to yard-arm; but the heavy shot of the first rate, although
long laid up in ordinary, and nearly invalided, told heavily on the mug of his
opponent. It was an up-and-down contest, and the Champion made such
good use of his time, that his opponent was quite satisfied he had enough,
and begged, in a piteous manner, that some person would take Cribb away
from him, or else he should be killed! This entreaty was at length complied
with; and upon the fallen hero getting upon his pins, the lads of the Fancy
declared, from his altered appearance, that it was meeting an old friend with
a new face. This severe thrashing scarcely occupied Cribb one minute! He
did not receive a hurt in the slightest degree. Carter upon feeling his mouth,
declared that part of his railings had departed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Until his formal retirement, Cribb never allowed his title of Champion to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>be questioned; and at the conclusion of the set-to between Harmer and
Lancaster, at the Fives Court, on August 7th, 1820, the Champion rushed
in, almost out of wind, made his way through the audience in a twinkling,
ascended the stage with great rapidity, and threw up his hat. With his
other hand he snatched out his pocket-book, and, with great animation and
good emphasis, spoke to the following effect—keeping in mind our immortal
bard’s advice to the actors, to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Suit the action to the word.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen,—I will fight Neate for 1000 guineas, or for 500 a-side
(bravo). I have been just told, while I was taking a few whiffs over some
cold brandy and water, that Neate had publicly challenged me. I therefore
lost no time to show myself before you. Gentlemen, I do not like this
chaffing behind a man’s back. I won’t have it. I am an Englishman; and
I will behave like one. An Englishman never refuses a challenge (thunders
of applause from all parts of the court). Neate is my countryman, but what
of that? If he refuses to meet me, I will fight any man in Bristol for 1,000
guineas, and stake £100 directly. Here’s the blunt! My countrymen used
me ill when I was last at Bristol; and Neate behaved rude to me (hear! and
‘Tom’s quite an orator; he must certainly have taken lessons from Thelwall.’)
Perhaps ‘the old fool’ may be licked; but I will give any of them some
trouble first before they do it (‘There is no one on the list can do it, Tom.’)
I will tell you, gentlemen, they say Neate shall fight my boy, Spring, because
they know he is unwell. This conduct isn’t right; my boy’s in a consumption
(loud laughter), therefore I will fight Neate instead of him (bravo). My boy
Spring has not got belly enough for him, but I have (clapping his hand upon
his rotundity of abdomen.) ‘You have too much of it.’ Never mind, then,
I am right enough about my bottom (great applause and laughter). I will
fight; and blow my dickey (striking his fist very hard on the rails of the
stage), but I will give any of them that fight me pepper (tumultuous cheering,
and ‘To a certainty you will, Tom.’)”</p>

<p class='c007'>This challenge of Neate, however, soon assumed a palpable form, for on
Thursday evening, January 4, 1821, the Champion having called in at the
Castle Tavern, to take a glass with his friend Tom Belcher, a swell from
Bristol, and an admirer of Neate, without ceremony proposed the battle.
The challenge was immediately taken up by Mr. James Soares, who felt for
the pride of the metropolitan prize ring, and offered to stake £100 if the
champion would consent to fight for the sum mentioned. Cribb answered,
that he had said he would not fight for less than £500 a-side, in consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>of his business, but there had been so much chaffing about it, that he would
fight Neate for £200 (loud cheers). The articles were immediately drawn
up, and signed by the respective parties:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>

<p class='c018'>“Mr. James Soares, on the part of Thomas Cribb, puts down £10; and Mr. J. E., on the
part of William Neate, also puts down £10; to fight for £200 a-side, between Bath and
London, on Wednesday, the 9th of May, 1821. To be a fair stand-up fight; half a minute

The whole of the stakes are to be deposited in the hands of Mr. Belcher, and who is
appointed to name the place of fighting. The sum of £100 a-side to be made good, at the
said Mr. Belcher’s, the Castle Tavern, Holborn, on the 24th of January, 1821. An umpire to
be chosen by each party, and Mr. Jackson to name referee. The whole of the money to be
made good, £200 a-side, on the 9th of April, 1821, at Mr. Cribb’s, the Union Arms, corner
of Panton and Oxendon Streets, Haymarket, between the hours of seven and ten o’clock in
the evening. In case of either party not making the £100 good, the above deposit, £20, to
be forfeited.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>A screw, it seems, had been loose between Neate and the Champion of
England for some time past, which was now to be decided by the fist.
Several wagers were immediately offered that the stakes were not made
good; more especially as Neate was to be consulted upon the subject. It
was, however, well known that Neate a short time ago offered to fight Cribb
for £200 a-side. The Champion was much too heavy, but the good effects
of training, it was thought, would put that all to rights. The sporting
world were all upon the alert, to see the ‘ould one’ once more take the
field. The Champion’s last memorable contest was with Molineaux, on
September 28, 1811; nearly ten years having elapsed without receiving a
challenge; Cribb ought not to fight—it was giving a chance away—so said
the knowing ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>At ten o’clock on the night mentioned (24th January), the articles were
called for and read; and the backer of Cribb (the President of the Daffy
Club), said his £100 was ready, but no person appearing on the part of
Neate, the deposit money, £10 a-side, was given up to the Champion. The
chairman then gave the health of Cribb. The Champion in returning thanks
for the honour he had received, said he “was much more capable—nay, he
would sooner fight than make a speech.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The chairman, in an appropriate speech, thought the sporting world ought
not to permit the Champion to accept any more challenges. It was upwards
of nine years and a half since he had entered the ring. He was growing old,
had young kids to provide for, and the gout now and then paid him a visit.
He had beaten all his opponents in the highest style of courage, but it could
not be expected that he could “get the best” of the infirmities of human
nature. Yet the Champion was too game to say “No” to any challenge.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>He thought Cribb ought to retain his championship till he was floored by Old
Time.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c009'><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Several first-rate amateurs, in short but pithy speeches, addressed the
meeting on the subject, and all of them concurred in the opinion of the
chairman: but, as to fighting, in future the Champion must “tie it up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the day of the Coronation, July 19, 1821, his Majesty, in passing down
the Hall, during the procession to the Abbey, cast a pleasing glance upon the
person of Mr. Jackson, by way of recognition, which convinced the Commander-in-Chief
of the P.R., that he still lived in the memory of his beloved
sovereign and once great patron. Tom Cribb and Tom Spring were also
habited as pages, guarding the entrance of Westminster Hall. The manly
appearance of the two “big ones” attracted the notice of most of the great
folks who were present at the gorgeous ceremony.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following letters of thanks were individually received by those
pugilists who assisted to keep the peace, and protect the persons of the
visitors at the Coronation:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Lord Gwydyr, presented one of the gold coronation medals, which he had
received from the hands of his Majesty King George the Fourth, to the boxers
who gave their assistance at Westminster Hall. His lordship also provided
a most excellent dinner for all the pugilists, at Tom Cribb’s, upon the occasion.
After the cloth was removed, and the health of the king drank with four
times four; the gold medal was raffled for, by the whole of the boxers, when
Tom Belcher proved the lucky man, and held the trophy until his death.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now come to our hero’s formal retirement; an event which excited
considerable interest throughout the circles of the fancy. On Saturday, May
18, 1822, the Champion of England made his bow to the amateurs, at the
Fives Court. Tom had to boast of a Corinthian attendance, and St. Martin’s
Street was filled with carriages. The sets-to were generally good. The
champion of England and Spring ascended the stage, amidst loud approbation.
Cribb was decorated with the belt. It was an excellent combat; and,
although Tom had a touch of the gout, he displayed great activity. But the
awful moment had now arrived for poor Tom to say, farewell! He scratched
his nob—looked about him—his heart full of gratitude—at a loss what to
say—and his tongue almost forsook its office. After a struggle to give vent
to his feelings, he at length delivered himself of the following words:—“Gentlemen,
I return you thanks for your kindness this day. (A short
pause.) Indeed, gentlemen, I sincerely thank you for all the favours you
have conferred on me—I do indeed. (A long pause, as if Tom had stuck
fast.) Gentlemen, may your health and purses never fail you.” Cribb now
retired, amid long and loud plaudits, accompanied with, “It will be a long
time before we shall look upon your like again in the prize ring.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Spring now mounted the stage, and thus addressed the spectators:—“Gentlemen,
I once more present myself to your notice; but as my old dad
has retired from the stage and the prize ring altogether, and as I have stood
next to him for some time past, I mean now to stand in his place, till I am
beat out of it!” An amateur and Spring went up to Tom Belcher, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>informed him that Spring was ready to fight Neate for £300. “Very well,”
replied the hero of the Castle; “now I know what you mean, we will talk
about it. I shall name it to Neate.” The result of this challenge will be
fully recorded in the Life of <span class='sc'>Tom Spring</span>, opening the next period.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this time Tom led the life of a retired veteran, but his house was the
rendezvous of sporting men. Cribb, however, occasionally figured in the
public prints, for then, as now, noisy, troublesome, and drunken fellows
annoyed licensed victuallers in their business. The <cite>Morning Herald</cite> thus
reports a “Morning at Bow Street.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Cribb and his Customer.</span>—The Champion brought a little shrivelled
tailor before Sir Robert Baker, on Tuesday, December 12, 1820, at Bow
Street, and charged the ninth part of a man with calling him, the said Champion,
‘a great big fighting cove;’ with exclaiming, ‘Oh, that I was but big
enough to whop you!’ and with frequenting his house, the Union Arms
Tavern, Panton Street, for the purpose of abusing him and annoying his
company. In reply to this, the little remnant of shreds and patches looked
up in the champion’s face, and humbly begged his pardon, promising most
solemnly, before his worship, never to offend in the like manner again.
Cribb’s placability is well known; he, who has so often stood unshaken
before the stoutest hearts in the ring, could not stand this pathetic appeal
from a forlorn little tailor, and, relaxing his features into a smile, he confessed
himself appeased, but trusted Master Snip would get rid of his bad
habits in future, and never more measure his way to the Union Arms:
or else if he did, Cribb said he would cut his cloth in a way that he would
not like. The hero of the needle was in consequence discharged. The
magistrate observed that he had heard the various houses kept by the champion
to have always been conducted with the utmost propriety. Cribb moved
his castor and retired.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is another of Tom’s magisterial interviews.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>The Three Tailors.</span>—Three natty tailors were charged, at Marlborough
Street Police Office, in September, 1826, with creating a disturbance, and
assaulting Thomas Cribb, the ex-champion of England. The defendants
went into Cribb’s house, where they partook of some liquor. After a few
minutes they commenced a disturbance, and he requested them to be quiet;
but they swore at him, and challenged him to fight. One of them being
pot-valiant, struck him. The example was followed by the others, who
insisted on his having a turn with them. A person said, “No, Cribb, don’t
strike the three tailors, who are only the third part of a man!” The
astonished tailors, on hearing his name mentioned, took up their clothes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>ran quickly out of the house; but Cribb, determining to teach them better,
pursued and lodged them in the hands of the watchman. Sir George Farrant:
‘Did they beat you?’ Cribb, smiling: ‘No, their blows were something
like themselves—of little importance.’ Sir George Farrant: ‘Did you return
the blow?’ Cribb: ‘No, sir, I was afraid of hurting ’em; I should not like
to do that.’ The tailors in their defence, said they were sorry for what had
occurred; at the same time, they were not aware that the person whom they
had challenged to fight was the Champion: on finding their mistake they
instantly left his house. Sir George Farrant: ‘Aye, you thought you had
better try the lightness of your heels than the weight of his fists.’ Cribb
declined making any charge against them, and they were discharged on paying
their fees.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Cribb and the Cobbler.</span>—In the same month the ex-champion again
made his bow before the beak; but, on this occasion, Bow Street was
honoured with his portly presence, where he charged a cobbler with causing
a disturbance in his house. Cribb said that the prisoner was, about two
years ago, very annoying, and he ordered him never to enter his house again.
A few days ago he renewed his visit; and on Wednesday night he was most
riotous and abusive. He (Cribb) did not care much for his abuse; but
he could not contain himself when the cobbler had the impudence to begin
abusing the king: he seized him under the arms, and dropped him gently in
the street. The magistrate told Cribb that he had on this, as on all other
occasions, evinced great forbearance, and directed the warrant to stand over;
and, if the prisoner annoyed him again, he would be committed to prison.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cribb’s declining years, however, were disturbed by domestic troubles and
severe pecuniary losses; and after a long struggle against adverse circumstances,
produced by lending money and becoming responsible for a relative,
he was forced to give up the Union Arms to his creditors. His last appearance
was on November 12, 1840, when under the auspices of the Pugilistic
Association, he took a benefit at the National Baths, Westminster Road.
At this time, and for some years previously, Cribb had resided at the house
of his son, a baker, in the High Street, Woolwich, where he died on the
11th of May, 1848, aged 67.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>CRIBB’S MONUMENT.</h5>

<p class='c013'>The editor of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> (Vincent G. Dowling, Esq.), and some friends
and admirers of the champion, having resolved to erect a monument to his
memory, the matter was thus spoken of in the columns of the leading sporting
paper of England, in the beginning of 1851.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“Among the interesting incidents connected with the approaching season
of the Great Exhibition, we have much pleasure in announcing the completion
of the long promised monument to the memory of Tom Cribb, one of the
most justly esteemed champions of the pugilistic school of England. As a
professor of his art he was matchless, and as a demonstrator of fair play, in
principle and in practice, he was never excelled. He had still a higher
virtue, displayed in sustaining throughout his gallant career, independent
of indomitable courage—a reputation for unimpeachable integrity and unquestionable
humanity. His hand was ever open to the distresses of his
fellow-creatures, and whether they befell friend or foe, he promptly, by
relieving them, exhibited the influence of the charitable and kindly impulses
of a truly benevolent heart—an example well worthy of imitation, and justly
entitling him to the present distinction, which, while it cherishes his
memory, will show to others of his class, who follow in his steps, that their
good deeds will live beyond the grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will be remembered that poor Cribb, after enjoying the sunshine of good
fortune for a series of years, respected by all classes, from the prince to the
peasant, o’erstepped the bounds of prudence and self-consideration, fell into
distress, and retired to the house of his son, at Woolwich, where after a
lingering illness, he died on the 11th May, 1848. Happily, through the
sympathy of those who felt as we felt, his last moments were soothed by the
enjoyment of every comfort, and he departed in peace, deeply grateful to
those whose kindness he had experienced. The last sad duty of consigning
his remains to their final resting place was performed in Woolwich churchyard,
his ashes mingling with those of naval and military heroes honourably
distinguished in their respective vocations. We took care that every expense
connected with his illness and death was defrayed, but we still felt that such
a man should not depart from among us without some lasting token of the
estimation in which the noble qualities by which he had been distinguished
were held, and therefore suggested the erection of a monument to his memory—such
a monument as would honour and preserve it. This suggestion
received a ready response. Our work is now nearly accomplished, and we
would fain hope it will be found to fulfil our desire, that of showing to our
expected foreign visitors, as well as to our countrymen, that, however
humble our heroes, where valour is accompanied by sterling honesty and
humanity, we have pride in commemorating their deeds and their virtues....</p>

<p>CRIBB’S MONUMENT IN WOOLWICH CHURCHYARD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“The grave over which this monument is to be erected has long since
been bricked and covered with a suitable slab. Upon this will be placed a
plinth, also of solid Portland stone, about two feet in height, to receive the
statue. On the edge of the plinth will be engraved this impressive sentence,
‘Respect the ashes of the brave.’ The grave being on an elevated
bank close to the path leading to the church from the town of Woolwich, the
whole will command the attention of all persons entering the burial ground
from London, or passing along that thoroughfare immediately in front, which
at all hours of the day is thronged with soldiers, sailors, dockyard men, and
civilians.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We hardly doubt that this monument, from the moral it is calculated to
enforce, will be without its beneficial effects on the minds of all those by
whom it is seen, and we trust it may be gratifying to those strangers who on
their visits to the Arsenal will have an opportunity of witnessing the veneration
in which Englishmen hold the memory of those who, although not
‘licensed’ warriors, are yet honest types of our national principles and
character.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the eve of the first of May, 1854, the monument, of which we here
give an engraving, was placed in the position it now occupies in Woolwich
Churchyard, and its first view by the public was coincident with the first
opening of the first Great Exhibition in Hyde Park. We again quote <cite>Bell’s
Life</cite>:—“Far be it from us to connect this simple occurrence further than in
point of time with the Exhibition in question; but the coincidence is
fortunate, and the object creditable to those by whom it has been carried
out—that object being to testify the respect entertained for the memory of a
man who, in his position, entitled himself to universal respect for his unimpeachable
honesty, indomitable courage, and unquestionable humanity. Exception
may be taken to the sphere in which those qualities were exhibited, but
those acquainted with English feeling, English character, and English habits
must hold in estimation the memory of a man who, in his own person and by
his own acts, impressed on thousands, we might say millions, those principles
of fair play, combined with gallant bearing, which have been the distinguishing
features of our countrymen, soldiers, sailors, or civilians, in whatever
circumstances placed. From these feelings sprung a desire to erect the
present monument, for the double purpose of perpetuating the memory of
the most distinguished of his class, and of impressing on those who followed
in his footsteps the sense entertained of the virtues he so prominently displayed.
A subscription was commenced, at the head of which were the
names of noblemen and gentlemen of the highest rank, swollen by more
humble contributors. The work has been accomplished, thanks to the
unceasing assiduity and generous devotion of Mr. Timothy Butler, the
sculptor, who has performed his task in a manner that must increase his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>reputation, and entitle him to a distinguished position in the profession
of which he is so bright an ornament. The design is simple yet grand in its
conception. It represents a British lion grieving over the ashes of a British
hero; for, putting aside all prejudice, Cribb was a hero of whom his country
might well be proud. The drawing affords a correct idea of the monument,
but falls short of the effect of the original; for we do not believe there is in
existence a more beautiful specimen of animal sculpture, whether we regard
the exquisite proportions of the figure, or the deep impression of sorrow
expressed on the countenance. The paw of the lion, it will be seen, rests on
an urn supposed to contain the ashes of the dead, over which is lightly thrown
the belt which was presented to Cribb as ‘the Champion of England.’ For
obvious reasons—principally the close proximity to the House of Peace—all
allusion to the circumstances which have led to this distinction is avoided,
and the inscription is simply this:—‘Sacred to the Memory of Thomas
Cribb, born July 8, 1781, died May 11, 1848.’ On the plinth beneath are
the words—‘Respect the ashes of the brave’—an inscription which, it is
hoped, will prevent those encroachments in which idle visitors to a churchyard
but too often indulge. The lion, of colossal size, stands on a rock,
and the whole was sculptured from a solid block of Portland stone weighing
twenty tons, from which some idea may be formed of the labour and perseverance
with which such a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d’œuvre</span></i> has been accomplished and removed
without accident from the studio of the artist in Middlesex Place, New Road,
to its present position. The monument stands on a plinth which elevates it
among surrounding tombs, rendering it visible even from the river Thames;
while from the footpath, in front of the churchyard, it invites immediate
attention as well as admiration—a sentiment which has been unequivocally
expressed by thousands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is fit we should state that there are some fastidious persons in Woolwich,
the town in which poor Cribb breathed his last, who find fault with
the erection of such a monument in such a place. It is due to the rector of
Woolwich, to state, that although he may in some respects participate in the
feelings of the parishioners, his objections were removed by the statement of
the fact, that before the monument was commenced, the drawing of the design
was submitted to his predecessor, by whom it was so heartily approved that
he regretted it could not be surrounded by an iron railing, to protect it from
trespassers, who are but too apt to treat with indifference the most exquisite
specimens of art.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c009'><sup>[143]</sup></a> There were, however, some words in the inscription to
which the rector did object, and which at his request have been omitted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Respect for this gentleman’s impressions has induced us to omit the following
not inappropriate epitaph:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘When some proud earl or rich patrician dies,</div>

      <div class='line'>And doubt the meed if giv’n to wealth or worth;</div>
      <div class='line'>But truth shall guide this record, and proclaim</div>
      <div class='line'>Who raised himself without a crime to fame;</div>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER II.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>THOMAS MOLINEAUX (THE COLOURED COMPETITOR FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP)—1810‒1815.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Thomas Molineaux, the hardy, determined and dangerous opponent of
Cribb, under whose memoir we have already given the details of the two
championship contests, next deserves a niche in the temple of fistic fame.
Unnoticed, unheralded, unfriended, and unknown, this sable gladiator made
his way to London. His skill and strength had been tried in several combats
in his native country, Virginia. Confident in his own capabilities, no sooner
did he arrive in the world’s metropolis, than, proceeding to the best known
sporting houses, he offered himself as a candidate for pugilistic honours. He
was not long before he attracted the notice of the patrons of those gymnastic
sports, which, from their practice and support, instil the principles of endurance
and courage into the hardy sons of England, and have not only given greatness
but added stability to the national character.</p>

<p class='c007'>Molineaux deserves credit for his bold challenge of the highest prize of
pugilism; his merits were certainly of no mean order, and his defeat adds to
the honours of the conqueror of such a formidable antagonist.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THOMAS MOLINEAUX.<br /><br /><em>From a Drawing by</em> <span class='sc'>George Sharples</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Molineaux’s trial set-to was with an anonymous Bristol man, on Tuesday,
July 14th, 1810. The papers inform us, “the newly come American black
is a formidable fellow; in height five feet nine inches, his weight between
thirteen and fourteen stone, his age twenty-six years. He was introduced
under the auspices of his coloured countryman, Bill Richmond, who seconded
him. Tom Cribb, waiting upon the Bristol man, who was a robust but
rather clumsy fellow of six feet in height, weight not stated. The scene of
action was Tothill Fields. The Bristol boxer was strong and game; but,
beyond these qualities he was a poor specimen of the west country school.
The black kept himself close, but seemed to have little idea of delivering
at distance. He merely ‘flipped’ or hit at half-arm, and when he struck
kept his elbows close to his body. His style of in-fighting, however, was
peculiar, and he caught his big antagonist so heavily and frequently in the
body as to knock the wind out of him, and then began to practise upon his
head so dexterously that at the end of an hour of desperate up-hill fighting
the Bristol man was compelled to give in, scarcely a feature in his face being
distinguishable. The two seconds, Cribb and Richmond, had a quarrel concerning
an alleged foul blow, and had a short sharp turn-up by way of a
second course. There was but one round, but that quite satisfied Richmond,
who is too good a judge to take a thrashing ‘for love,’ which he might soon
have had. Although not the most expert boxer that ever offered himself for
pugilistic fame, Molineaux was considered a promising ‘Chicken,’ and was
immediately matched for 100 guineas with Tom Blake, better known by the
title of Tom Tough, who was at this time forty years of age, and whose
battles are related in the Appendix, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 236.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tuesday, August 21, 1810, was the day fixed, and the spot where
Richmond and Maddox last contended agreed upon, on the coast about
four miles from Margate, and two from Reculvers. At an early hour every
vehicle was in motion to gain the goal of sport, and at one o’clock Blake
came in dashing style, seated in an honourable baronet’s barouche, with
his seconds, Tom Cribb and Bill Gibbons. A ring was formed, and at
half past one Molineaux was modestly introduced by his humble, but
perhaps more firm, supporter Richmond. After the usual ceremony the
combatants set-to.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—There was considerable curiosity
among the “swell” division to see the
new specimen in ebony, on whose merits
Massa Richmond was so eloquent to all
visitors to the Horse and Dolphin. There
was some cautious sparring for about a
minute, in which Molineaux showed he had
taken lessons and improved by them. Soon,
however, Blake<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c009'><sup>[144]</sup></a> seized an opening, put in
two smart hits right and left, and stopped
Molineaux’s return. The men closed and
fought at half-arm. Blake slipped from
Molineaux, but while in the act received a
tremendous chopping blow on the back of
his neck, which Molineaux repeated with
his right hand over the head, and brought
him down. (Betting even.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Blake again made play, but soon
found that two or three hits, although well
planted, were not sufficient to throw Molineaux
off his legs. He received the hits
with great <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>, and at length beat
down his opponent’s guard with his left hand,
and with a degree of quickness and dexterity,
which in Dutch Sam or Tom Belcher would
have been considered an astonishing effort
of science, brought Blake down by a most
severe blow with the right. (Six to four on
the Black.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Blake evinced great distress in his
wind. Molineaux run in to take advantage,
but was received with a chattering jaw hit.
They rallied, and both fell, Molineaux
uppermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—A hard round, and such a one as convinced
the judges that Blake had trained
off. Molineaux rendered his guard perfectly
useless, as by strength of hitting he broke
through it, and although Blake planted
many good blows, they had not an equal
effect to those of his opponent, as his face
sufficiently exemplified. The round lasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>two minutes, obstinate ruffianing fighting,
and Blake, after putting in a good body hit,
was knocked down. (Odds rose five to two
in favour of Molineaux.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Blake bled copiously, but with great
courage rushed to a rally, in which Molineaux
got his left arm round his neck, and
holding his head up, fibbed him so dreadfully
that Blake fell exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Molineaux now thought it time to
beat his man off hand. He rushed in,
chopped down his opponent’s guard with his
left hand, and knocked him completely off
his legs with his right, by a tremendous hit.
(Any odds in favour of Molineaux.)</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Blake in this round rallied determinedly;
he exchanged some good hits
dexterously, but was too weak for this work,
and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—This was the last round. Molineaux
began as furiously as in the sixth. Blake
retreated, but was forced to rally, to extricate
himself from the iron grasp of his
adversary. He put in a successful hit on
Molineaux’s cheek, but it was returned so
forcibly on the head, that it laid him asleep
for some time.</p>

<p class='c022'>The time having expired, Blake was still
insensible, and accordingly Molineaux was
acknowledged the victor.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—In this battle Molineaux
evinced great improvement in the science of
pugilism, particularly in the art of giving,
while nature seemed to have endowed him
abundantly with the gift of taking, his body
being almost callous to fistic punishment.
It was generally considered that should he
be able to combine an equal degree of skill
with his gluttony, he would mill the whole
race of modern pugilists.</p>

<p class='c013'>Encouraged by his friend and countryman Richmond, and patronised by
some leading amateurs, the aspiring nigger now avowed his aim was no less
than the championship. Molineaux, with the vanity so remarkably characteristic
of his race, never ceased amusing his visitors and patrons with
grotesque illustrations of how he would serve out “Massa Cribb,” for he
possessed, mixed with a considerable amount of ferocity, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis comica</span></i> of the
negro race. This could not go on long, and a match was made for 200
guineas, to come off December 18th, 1810. How this event was decided at
Copthorne, near East Grinstead, Essex, may be read in the Life of <span class='sc'>Cribb</span>,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 254.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding this defeat, Molineaux felt that he was entitled to
another chance, and accordingly sent a challenge three days after the
battle, which letter will be found in its proper place, at p. 255, under
Cribb’s second victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time Bob Gregson, who was fond of match-making, had at his
hostelrie a young Lancashire man of the name of Rimmer, twenty-two years
of age, and considered by his countrymen a second Jem Belcher. His friends
were anxious to get him on with Molineaux, now defeated, and issued a
challenge for 100 guineas, which was directly answered on the part of
Molineaux. The day was fixed for May 21, 1811, and accordingly at the
well-trodden hurst of Moulsey, at one o’clock on the appointed day, Rimmer
threw his hat into a twenty-five feet roped ring, pitched by the commissary-general
Bill Gibbons, who, moreover, in company with Richmond, performed
the duty of second to Molineaux. The like office to Rimmer was delegated
to Power and Tom Jones. The betting on starting was three to one on
Molineaux.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—A couple of minutes were spent
in sparring, in which neither man displayed
much grace, though both looked formidable.
Rimmer then let go both hands, but was
short; he got away without a return. More
sparring; at length Molineaux put in a left-handed
blow on his adversary’s neck with
great force; Rimmer returned, but slightly,
and fell. (Four to one on Molineaux.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Rimmer again made play, and another
effort to hit right and left, but the distance
was again ill-judged, and he got away.
Molineaux waited very patiently for him;
they rallied, and Molineaux made some excellent
stops. They broke away and got
together again, when Molineaux brought
down his opponent by two hits, right and
left, of most astonishing force and quickness.
(Odds four to one in favour of Molineaux.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Molineaux appeared much elated with
his success, smiled significantly at his opponent,
and sparred low, evidently to show he
disregarded any effort he might attempt.
He waited until Rimmer made play, when
he hit him, and following him up, repeated
his blows until Rimmer fell, but apparently
from no other cause than to avoid a repetition
of the tremendous hits he had received.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Rimmer’s head was covered with
blood, and he was, in fact, stupefied for a
time, in consequence of a blow on the temple
in the last round. Molineaux again put in
two successful hits right and left, over his
guard, on the head and neck, and Rimmer
fell as if shot. Every one now sympathised
with the dreadful situation of the novice,
and odds rose to any amount in favour of
Molineaux, but no takers.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Rimmer evinced great alertness, made
a long hit at double distance, and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Rimmer again hit short, and fell, evidently
very weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—For the first time Rimmer had the
best of fighting in this round; he put in a
good blow with his left hand, and rallied
with great courage, but fell at length over
his opponent’s legs.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Both hit over, and Rimmer fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Rimmer exerted every effort to gain
the superiority, rallied well, and threw
Molineaux.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Molineaux appeared almost ferocious,
and went in determined to repay him for
past favours. He followed Rimmer, milling
him to every part of the ring, and at length
floored him.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Rimmer rallied, and showed pluck.
Some good hits exchanged, but Rimmer hit
widely, without judging distance, and gave
his head doubled in his chest, which stopped
several blows, and he at length came down.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Rimmer made a body hit, which
again fell short, and almost in a state of
frenzy he ran in, caught Molineaux up by
the thighs, and threw him in the Lancashire
style. Many cried “Foul,” others “Fair,”
but the fight went on.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Rimmer struck Molineaux over the
mouth, when the Black ran in and threw
him.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—A rally. Rimmer closed, and a complete
trial of strength ensued. Both fell,
Rimmer bringing down his man by Lancashire
ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Rimmer retreated round the ring,
Molineaux following, and at length by a
severe blow in the wind, brought him down,
when he was indisputably “dead beat.”</p>

<p class='c022'>At this time the ring was broken; peers,
ploughmen, fighting men, chimney-sweepers,
costermongers, were all in one tumultuous
uproar, which continued for at least twenty
minutes, without any reason being assignable.
At length, however, by the exertions
of Cribb and others, the ring was restored,
and the combatants, who had neither left
the ring, were again set-to. Six more
rounds were fought, but greatly to the discomfiture
of Rimmer, who could hardly
stand. During this time he received about
ten more tremendous blows and then gave
in. Rimmer displayed great courage; he
has an unfortunate knack of giving his head
when he hits, and appears to be timid of
advancing towards his adversary, by which
errors many blows fall short.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the contemporary report: the slang version may be found in
“Boxiana,” vol. i., pp. 365, 366. Of the formidable powers of Molineaux at
this time, of which some writers who recorded his later career have expressed
themselves sceptical, this battle and that with Blake must be convincing
proof. No pugilist from this time offered a challenge to Molineaux, nor
could he get a battle on until Tom Cribb, who had publicly announced his
retirement from the ring, was called upon to “prevent the championship
of England from being held by a foreigner,” or as Pierce Egan oddly calls
the American nigger ‘a Moor’. Poor Pierce’s geography was sadly confused,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>and the term “the Moor” occurs—perhaps from some jumbled reminiscences
of <cite>Othello</cite>, in his stage readings—in a hundred places in his work
as a favourite epithet for the States’ black whose ring career we are now
tracing. Molineaux had now once again to enter the lists with the Champion,
which he did on the 28th September, 1811, at Thistleton Gap, Leicestershire,
where, after a desperate battle of less than twenty minutes, he fell before
the conquering arm of Cribb. See p. 256, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The losers who have, according to the proverb, “leave to grumble,” were
loud, in speech and in the press, upon the depressing influences of prejudice,
jealousy, envy, and “apprehension” lest “a black should win the championship.”
Very natural is all this, and would be so again; but nothing unfair
was ever substantiated. Pierce Egan thus sums up (vol. i., pp. 367‒370),
which we condense in quotation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was this prejudice, a disheartening one to bear up against, that
Molineaux, by never even approaching to unfairness, and by the exercise of a
manly forbearance in critical situations, was called on to remove; he could
not help seeing the applause and cheering were decidedly on the part of the
Champion; in fact, the man of colour experienced from the bulk of the
spectators a very different reception, occasioned by the extreme anxiety
of the friends of Cribb for the safety of his honour and renown; for his sable
opponent was truly formidable. These observations, nevertheless do not
pluck a single leaf from his well-merited laurels; but impartiality must
supersede every other consideration. It would be absurd to say that Molineaux
underwent anything like a regular training; on the contrary, he
indulged himself to excess—without a patron, he had to range from town to
town, to support himself by exhibitions of sparring, and entering into all the
glorious confusion of larks and sprees that might present themselves; while
far different was the position of the Champion. Placed under the immediate
direction of Captain Barclay, and secluded from the world at the estate of
that gentleman in far Scotland, his condition was in the finest possible tone,
his mind cheerful, and he felt confident that every chance was in favour of
his success. Molineaux, in spite of his undoubted high courage, laboured
under considerable depression; wherever he went he was unpopular; which
circumstance was considerably heightened upon his public appearance to face
his antagonist. His constitution, too, was by no means so good as in the
former contest: but his efforts were tremendous and terrible, and for the first
few rounds of the battle the flash side trembled for the result.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Molineaux about this period entered upon a downward course: the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">facilis
descensus</span></i> was fully exemplified. He quarrelled with all his best friends,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>scorned advice, and declared himself on all occasions, especially when
maddened with liquor, an ill-used man. A street fight with Power, in which
Molineaux had the best for seventeen minutes’ roughing, is recorded in
“Boxiana.” However his fame and name were a passport to money-getting,
and he started on a provincial tour, to gather the silver of gaping rustics,
who would pay willingly to see the man who fought the Champion twice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Molineaux was also a pretty good wrestler, and displayed great activity
and powers at the Exeter meeting of July 27, 1812, where he entered himself
for the public prize of ten guineas, but received a dreadful fall from John
Snow, of Moreton.</p>

<p class='c007'>We find the following paragraph in the <cite>Leicester Mercury</cite>, of Feb. 3rd, 1813:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jay, the pugilist, has challenged Molineaux to fight at any notice he
may please, but Blackee remains both deaf and dumb to this challenge, as
he did to Cribb’s immediate acceptance of a vaunting challenge to him.
The champion promises him a love-dressing for his bounce, if he could be
prevailed on to come to London.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To which Molineaux replied,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Leicester</span>, <em>February 10th, 1813</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“I, the said Molineaux, do declare that I never received any challenge, but through the
medium of your print; but I am ready to fight Jay at any place within the county of
Leicester, for a sum not exceeding £200, if accepted within one month of the above date.
In opposition to that part of the paragraph which relates to Cribb, I do declare that I sent
him a challenge within two months, but I have received no answer; my friends being mentioned
in the challenge, who would back me to any amount; and that I have never received
any challenge from Cribb since I last fought him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“N.B. Letters left at the Post Office, Leicester, will be duly attended to.</p>

      <div class='line'>“The mark of <span class='fixed'>X</span> THOS. MOLINEAUX.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We will now refer back to the all-important and absorbing event of our
hero’s second contest with Cribb, from which eighteen months elapsed before
Molineaux met with a competitor in Carter, a Lancashire man, though he
repeatedly challenged all England. This match, however, went off for a
time, owing to Richmond, his erewhile patron, “guide, philosopher, and
friend,” issuing a writ against him and taking him to a sponging house upon
a <em>ca. sa.</em> This is now a bit of antiquated law for which our fathers smarted,
and for which the young “Templars” may refer to their “Reader,” while we
congratulate <em>our</em> reader that John Roe and Richard Doe are defunct, and no
more “seize the body until the debt is satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Richmond was now at war to the knife with Molineaux, and made a match
for Carter to fight his late protégé for 100 guineas, on Friday, the 2nd April,
1813, when the men met at Remington, Gloucestershire, six miles from
Banbury, at the junction of four counties. That there was a doubt about the
honesty of this fight, the subjoined extracts from contemporary papers will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>show:—“Previous to the battle, the articles were read over to the combatants,
in which it was stated that the winner was to have a purse of 100
guineas—when Carter stepped up, inquiring what the ‘loser was to have!!!’
Richmond, who was his second, gnashed his teeth and shrugged up his
shoulders; Bob Gregson, his friend and patron, tremblingly alive as to the
event of the contest, and flattering himself that Lancashire would prove
proudly triumphant on this occasion, animatedly exclaimed, ‘Jack, never
talk of losing, boy—thee must win, the chance is all in thy favour!’”</p>

<p class='c007'>As we have already said Richmond seconded Carter, with Cooper as his
junior counsel; Joe Ward and Bill Gibbons held briefs for Molineaux. Six
to four, and in some instances three to one, were betted on the black. We
regret to say that the only report we can discover of this battle is that by
Pierce Egan, which, with some necessary pruning of slang and corrections
of ungrammatical phrases must serve, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faute de mieux</span></i>:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—It was the opinion of the most
experienced pugilists that such a set-to was
never before witnessed; one “was afraid,
and the other dared not,” and two minutes
were trifled away in this sort of caricaturing,
when Carter touched Molineaux on the
mouth, who genteelly returned it. They
closed, and the man of colour was thrown.
It would be absurd to detail by way of
rounds any more of this worst of fights,
though we readily admit that Carter was
the best man after the battle began, and
continued so throughout the fight. Molineaux
was wretched in the extreme, and at
one time bolted from his second, and had
it not been for Colonel and Captain Barclay,
he would never have returned to the scratch,
he wished so much to get away. At another
period he was down on one knee, and with
both hands laid fast hold of the ropes, and
being hit in this situation, he roared out
lustily “Foul!” but he was given to understand
that, by the laws of boxing, no one is
considered down “without having both knees
on the ground, with either one or both hands
also.” In the fifteenth round he was so
terrified that, upon being driven to one
corner of the ring, he cried out lamentably,
“Oh dear! oh dear! murder!” a little previous
to which, he declared Carter “had bit
him in the neck!” and soon afterwards he
repeated, “there, he has bit me again!” and
it was with great difficulty Joe Ward could
persuade him that it was the knuckles of
Carter, and not his mouth. This the once
brave competitor of the champion! impossible!
Could he have thus degenerated?
Twenty-five rounds occurred, in which coaxing,
persuading, dramming, and threatening,
were resorted to, in order to make the man
of colour perform something like fighting.
But to the great astonishment of all the
spectators, when Molineaux was dead beat,
Carter fainted, and dropped his head as he
sat on the knee of his second. With all the
exertions of Richmond, it seems, he could
not arouse Carter from his lethargic state,
and he thus lost the battle in not coming to
time. His fame, it is urged, was not only
tarnished from this circumstance, but even
his integrity called into question. The
above battle created universal dissatisfaction.</p>

<p class='c022'>Poor Bob Gregson, agitated beyond description
at seeing Lancashire (as he considered)
thus trampled on with disgrace,
went up to Carter, exclaiming, “Jack, Jack,
what be’est thee at? get up and fight,
man!” But Bob might as well have sung
psalms to a dead horse. Carter, some little
time afterwards raised his head, feebly observing,
“Stop a bit! stop a bit!” And
whether by accident, design, or with an intent
to conclude this farce in style we are
not in the secret to unfold, but a disciple of
Esculapius stepped up, and in the twinkling
of an eye pulled out his lancet, and bled
Carter, to the great astonishment of his
friends and the spectators in general; thus
preventing, even had any inclination remained
on the side of Carter to have renewed
the fight. The latter’s clothes had
hitherto been preserved, during the fight, in
the chariot of a man of distinction, but who,
it is said, was so disgusted with the scene
before him, that he instantly ordered them
to be thrown out with disdain and contempt.
In once more taking a slight view of the man
of colour, whatever certainty there might have
been of Molineaux being a sound man at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>core, it is strongly urged that if his heart
had been a good one, he must have won the
first battle with the champion; however, be
that as it may, since that period he has been
dissipated to excess, completely gone off in
constitution, and broken winded. One improvement
appeared to have taken place:
he was more temperate in setting-to, but he
did not like to face his man, and it required
no small ingenuity to get him into the ring.</p>

<p class='c013'>With this specimen of “the historian’s” style we dismiss the affair of
Carter and Molineaux. We shall hear more of the so-called “Lancashire
hero,” when we come to the life of <span class='sc'>Tom Spring</span> in the next Period.</p>

<p class='c007'>Molineaux once more started on a tour, extending it this time to Scotland,
where he exhibited sparring in the principal towns. The black, like most of
his race, had a childish propensity for gaiety, and a strong passion for dress,
was amorously inclined, and devoted himself by turns to Bacchus and Venus.
Of course the Black Samson met with many mercenary Dalilahs, and—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in30'>“Plung’d</div>
      <div class='line'>In general riot, melted down his youth</div>
      <div class='line'>In different beds of lust, and never learn’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The icy precepts of respect, but follow’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The sugar’d game before him.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With dress of the best quality and fashion, the man of colour soon appeared
a swell of the first magnitude. Maintaining, then, the highest secondary
rank as a boxer, he dashed about regardless of future consequences to his
milling fame. Pleasure was the order of the day with him, and the stews
tended not only to ease him of his cash, but soon undermined that overwhelming
power and pluck so conspicuously displayed in his terrible combats
with the mighty Cribb. The consequences of such a line of conduct need be
scarcely dwelt on; the iron frame of the black soon seriously felt the dilapidating
effects of intemperance. Yet, notwithstanding this visible falling off,
Molineaux with all the drawbacks of enervating excess, was not to be beaten
off hand, and none but a boxer of more than common skill and strength
seemed likely to accomplish this task.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fuller, a clever and well-informed man, who had beaten Bill Jay, and
whose character for science and game entitled him to every consideration,
fancied he was able to contend with this renowned milling hero, and the
amateurs of Scotland, in order to facilitate a match between them, entered
into a subscription purse of 100 guineas, to be fought in a forty feet ring.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Early in the morning, on the day appointed for the above trial of skill to be
decided, Friday, the 27th May, 1814, at Bishopstorff, Paisley, Ayrshire, the
fancy were in motion. Numerous vehicles of all descriptions were seen
rattling along the road to the scene of action, and scampering pedestrians
out of number, to witness the novelty of a prize-mill in Scotland. Some
thousands of spectators formed the ring, and upwards of one hundred
carriages belonging to gentlemen were upon the ground. Molineaux was
seconded by Carter, and Fuller had the veteran Joe Ward and George
Cooper. Five to four on the black. At one o’clock the ceremony of shaking
hands was performed, and the men set-to. Both the combatants displayed
good science, but the blows of Fuller, although he put in several with much
dexterity, appeared more showy than effective. However, on Fuller’s planting
a desperate ribber, Joe Ward ironically observed, that “if he continued
to hit his man so hard, they should all be baulked, and the fight be over too
soon.” The battle had continued only eight minutes, when the sheriff
of Renfrewshire, attended by constables, entered the ring, and put a stop to
it in the fourth round. Both the combatants appeared much chagrined,
particularly Molineaux, who vauntingly declared, “had he foreseen such an
interruption, he would have finished off his opponent before the arrival of the
sheriff.” The man of colour, it seems, was so confident of victory, that
previous to the fight, he betted five to two he drew first blood—this bet he
won; and also two to one he floored Fuller first—the latter was not decided.
Fuller expressed himself ready to settle the matter the next day, but
Molineaux insisted the fight should not take place till the following Tuesday.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above arrangement was agreed to, and on Tuesday, May 31, they
again met at Auchineux, twelve miles from Glasgow. Fuller was attended
by Ward and Cooper, Molineaux by an Irish sergeant, of the name of Hailward,
assisted by a private. The umpires were Captain Cadogan and Mr.
George Stirling, and in case of any dispute, Mr. Graham, of Guntmaux, as
the referee. This battle is without parallel. There is nothing like it in the
annals of pugilism. It is thus described by the veteran Joe Ward, from
whom the account given in “Boxiana” was gathered, and which we here
reprint:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Fuller displayed some good
positions, and convinced the spectators that
he was a scientific boxer. His guard was
firm and imposing, and he seemed confident
of success. They sparred a considerable
time, with good skill, before any punishment
was exhibited; at length Fuller, by a tremendous
hit, drew the cork of his antagonist.
Molineaux, upon the claret making
its appearance, became rather impetuous,
and attacked Fuller fiercely; but the latter
stopped with much adroitness, and gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>some heavy nobbing returns. A desperate
rally now took place, during which severe
milling was dealt out on both sides; the
men broke away, and again resorted to
sparring. Fuller’s nose was much peppered,
and the crimson flowed abundantly. In
short, this unprecedented round was filled
with rallies, recoveries, retreating, following
each other alternately round the ring, stopping
and hitting with various success, and
both exhausted by turns, till at length Molineaux
was levelled by a tremendous blow,
and the round finished after a lapse of
twenty-eight minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—To describe anything like the various
changes which occurred during this set-to
would fill the space of an ordinary report of
a whole fight. Suffice it to observe, that
almost every “dodge” of the milling art
was resorted to, from beginning to end.
The skill, practice, and experience of both
the combatants were made use of to the best
advantage. Fuller proved himself a boxer
of more than ordinary science and game.
Molineaux was convinced he had got a troublesome
customer to deal with, who required
serving out in a masterly style before
he could be satisfied. In fact, the strength
of the man of colour seemed materially deteriorated
as compared with his former exhibitions,
when he used to hit his men away
from him, and levelled his opponent with
the most perfect <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>. The severe
blows of Fuller, who stuck close to Molineaux,
made him wince again. The Black
appeared much exhausted from the great
portion required to give, and heartily tired
of what he had to take. The claret was
liberally tapped on both sides, and as regarded
Fuller, stauncher game was never
displayed by any pugilist whatever. Upon
the whole, it was a truly singular fight, and
the people of Scotland witnessed the most
unique specimen of English prize-fighting.
In sixty-eight minutes two rounds only had
taken place.</p>

<p class='c022'>The contest terminated in rather a singular
manner. Molineaux asserted that “Joe
Ward had behaved foul, in pulling Fuller
down, when he was much distressed, and
had been beaten all over the ring in a rally;
and that this prevented him from putting in
a decisive blow.” The umpires decided it
was so, and the purse was accordingly
awarded to Molineaux. The latter did not
appear anything like the once tremendous
competitor of Cribb; on the contrary, instead
of going boldly up to his man, he was always
shy, and tried to win by tiring out his man.
Molineaux fought at the head, Fuller at the
body. Notwithstanding the supposed falling
off of the man of colour, it was considered
great temerity on the part of Fuller to enter
the lists with Molineaux. The conduct of
Fuller in this fight gave such general satisfaction,
that a purse of 50 guineas, which
had been subscribed for at the match between
Cooper and Carter, in consequence of
that battle not taking place, was presented
to Fuller.</p>

<p class='c013'>Molineaux now attracted great attention in Scotland, and a match was
at length made between him and George Cooper, a boxer of superior talent.
On the 11th of March, 1815, these first-rate heroes of the fist met at Corset
Hill, in Lanarkshire. In twenty minutes Molineaux was defeated. (See
life of <span class='sc'>George Cooper</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>, Chapter IV).</p>

<p class='c007'>Intemperance was the ruin of Molineaux; and, it would seem, that within
a brief period his fame had become so tarnished, that every strong commoner
entertained an idea that he could serve out the once formidable man of
colour, as the following anecdote will evince. During Molineaux’s provincial
tour of 1813, he visited Derby, to give the natives an exhibition of his
milling accomplishments. The competitor of Cribb was well attended, and
several Johnny Raws had the temerity to have a taste with the Black; but
these, possessing little more than strength and courage, soon found themselves
inadequate to contend against the science of Molineaux, and therefore
wisely laid down the gloves. Not so a country pugilist of the name of
Abraham Denston, possessing Herculean strength, and the stature of a giant,
added to which his fame was well abroad in these parts for milling, in which
none dared to oppose him. Abraham had rather “crept into favour with himself,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>and entertained an idea that, with the mufflers, he should be able to serve
out the nigger in style, and increase his renown as a miller. Great things
were expected from the countryman; and considerable interest was excited
among the spectators on their setting-to. But, unfortunately for Abraham,
he had calculated somewhat too hastily upon his great size and strength, and
two rallies with the Black were quite enough to convince him of his error.
Molineaux punished the chaw-bacon most severely for his self-conceit, and,
with one of his favourite left-handed lunges, gave him such a remembrancer
under his left eye, that the claret flew in all directions, and the big ’un found
his way to the ground, saluting it roughly with his seat of honour. The
conceit of Abraham now evaporated, and he hastily retired amidst the
laughter of the audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Scotland, Molineaux went on a sparring tour into Ireland; and at
the latter end of the year 1817, he was travelling over the northern parts
of that country, teaching the stick fighting natives the use of their fists;
an accomplishment which might save many a jury the trouble of a trial
ending in a verdict of manslaughter or even of murder. But the sun of his
prosperity was set; and according to an obituary sketch (given in the
<cite>Sporting Magazine</cite>, vol. ii., p. 230, 1818), he was dependent for bare
existence on the humanity of two coloured compatriots, serving in the 77th
regiment then quartered at Galway. He expired in the band-room of that
regiment, on the 4th of August, 1818, a wasted skeleton, the mere shadow
of his former self. For the last four years he strolled about the country.
Intemperance, and its sure follower disease, brought down the once formidable
gladiator to a mere anatomy, and he latterly declined to fight the oft-defeated
and gone-by Dan Dogherty. Molineaux was illiterate and ostentatious, but
good-tempered, liberal, and generous to a fault. Fond of gay life, fine clothes,
and amorous to the extreme, he deluded himself with the idea that his strength
of constitution was proof against excesses. Alas! poor Molineaux found out
the vanity of his conceited boast, and repented, but too late, his folly.
Peace be to his manes! he was a brave but reckless and inconsiderate man,
on whose integrity and straightforwardness none who knew him ever cast a
slur; nevertheless he was the worst of fools, inasmuch as he sacrificed fame,
fortune, and life; excusing himself by the absurd plea, that “he was a fool
to no one but himself.”</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>BILL RICHMOND—1804‒1818.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Quoad the biography of this clever man of colour, we may safely follow
“Boxiana,” seeing that he was a contemporary of Pierce Egan, who took his
accounts, for better or for worse, of what happened outside the circle of
his knowledge from one or other of the men whose memoirs are scattered
fragmentarily up and down the five volumes of his “Sketches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Richmond was born at a place called Richmond, otherwise Cockold’s
Town, on Staaten Island,<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c009'><sup>[145]</sup></a> New York, on August 5th, 1763. His mother
was owned by a reverend divine of the name of Charlton, to whose worldly
wealth young Bill was of course an accession. When the English troops, in
1777, held New York during the War of Independence, General Earl Percy,
afterwards Duke of Northumberland, finding Bill to possess good capacity
took him under his protection, and he served him for some time till he came
to England, whither he brought the sable youth with him, and considerately
put him to school in Yorkshire. Nor did the English nobleman stop here.
He apprenticed him to a cabinet maker in York, where he worked at his
trade with credit to himself and satisfaction to his employers. Richmond,
however, had the childish and nigger propensity for fine clothes and the
service of a “gran’ massa,” and as black servants were the fashion of the
day, he became what in the prevailing slang was called a “knight of the
rainbow,” taking service with that very “fast” nobleman Lord Camelford,
as Pierce Egan incidentally informs us.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first display in the pugilistic art which brought Bill into notice was
with one George Moore, a soldier in the 19th regiment, known by the name
of Docky Moore, who insulted Richmond upon the course at York, during
the time of the races. This Docky before his enlistment had been known as
“the hero of Sheffield.” He was well proportioned, possessing considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>strength, and the necessary requisites for milling; in height five feet nine
inches and a half, and weighing fourteen stone. The friends of Richmond
persuaded him from attempting to fight with such a man, Bill only weighing
ten stone twelve pounds; but he was not to be deterred, and the event proved
his judgment, for in the course of twenty-five minutes, our hero punished
Docky so completely that he gave in, and was taken out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the same course, not long after the above affair, in a quarrel arising
out of the former exploit, Richmond beat two soldiers, one after the other,
belonging to the Inniskillen dragoons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richmond’s milling qualities getting noised abroad, a few of the Yorkshire
lads who had a bit of fight in their composition, envied his success. One in
particular, a blacksmith weighing thirteen stone, and in height about five
feet ten inches, took the following method of provoking Bill to have a brush.
Richmond was noticed in York for going smart, and appearing clean after he
had done his work. Bill met this hammer-man one evening, as he was taking
a walk, who openly insulted him with opprobrious epithets. Our hero remonstrated
with him on the impropriety of his behaviour, and told the blacksmith
that if he wanted to fight him he should be accommodated at the Groves the
next morning, on which they agreed to meet, when the son of Vulcan was
quickly satisfied, and acknowledged Richmond the best man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richmond, in passing through the streets of York one evening, with
a female under his protection, was accosted by one Frank Myers, with the
epithets of “black devil,” etc, who otherwise insulted the young woman for
being in company of a man of colour. Bill, with a becoming spirit of
indignation, requested him to desist for the present, but to meet him at the
Groves on the next Monday morning, when they would settle this difference
(this circumstance happening on a Saturday night), to which Myers agreed.
This affair of honour being buzzed about, a great concourse of people
assembled early the next day to witness the conflict. Richmond was there
at the appointed hour, but after a considerable time, Myers not making his
appearance, the spectators became impatient, and it was judged expedient
that Richmond and his friends should repair to the house of Myers to remind
him of his engagement. Myers returned with them, and the battle commenced,
and raged with fury for some time, Myers getting the worst of it,
and eventually Richmond taught him to acknowledge that it was wrong, and
beneath the character of an Englishman, to insult any individual on account
of his country or his colour. Myers received a complete milling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richmond’s first public set-to in London was with a whip-maker of the
name of Green, in the fields near White Conduit House. Phips Medley
seconded Richmond, who got the whip-hand of Green in such good style,
that in ten minutes he cried—enough!</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>Thus far Pierce Egan, whose apocrypha we will now quit.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the battle between Pearce (the Game Chicken) and Joe Berks,
on Wimbledon Common, Jan. 23rd, 1804 (see life of <span class='sc'>Pearce</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 170),
George Maddox having disposed of Seabrook in three rounds (see the account
of this cross in life of <span class='sc'>Maddox</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 208), our sable hero expressed to his
master (Lord Camelford) his opinion that he could polish off “the veteran.”
A stake, amount not mentioned, was immediately posted. “Old George,
nothing loth, declared his readiness. But the new black turned out a
‘duffer,’ George hitting him down the third time with a crack under the left
eye, which so completely queered his ogle that he gave out.”<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c009'><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On Tuesday, May 21, 1805, Tom Cribb, having beaten the ponderous
Israelite “Ikey Pig,” the tribes were in desolation and mourning. At this
juncture a Jew known as fighting Youssop (Joseph), came forward, like
another Maccabeus, to do battle in honour of his peoplesh, but not with the
same success, and “See the conquering hero comes,” was not sung that night
by the Israelitish virgins of Rosemary Lane or Duke’s Plashe. Here is the
report: “The ring being cleared, one Youssop, a Jew, who turned out to be
more ready than able, stepped forward to redeem the valorous character
of his fraternity, when a match was proposed for him in Bill Richmond, the
American black, for which a purse of ten guineas was soon collected. The
Jew accepted his opponent; they stripped, shook hands, and set-to without
loss of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The battle was well contested, neither man flinching from his work, or
falling without a knock-down. For the first and second rounds Youssop
showed off his dexterity, and this superiority he particularly displayed in the
third round, when he stopped Richmond neatly and followed him up till he
drove him nearly out of the ring. He did not, however, seem to mark or
hurt his man. In the fourth round Richmond improved, and following up
his opponent in turn gave him several desperate blows in the face, sadly to
the disfigurement of the Mosaic countenance. Youssop gave way altogether,
and at the close of the sixth round declared, like Ikey Pig, ‘He’d have no
more of it.’ Richmond accordingly was proclaimed the conqueror, and
pocketed the stakes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This battle raised Richmond’s credit as a pugilist, and he soon received a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>challenge from “Jack Holmes,” the coachman,<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c009'><sup>[147]</sup></a> who on the 30th of
January, in the preceding year, had been conquered by Tom Blake (Tom
Tough), see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 235. Here is the report:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Fletcher Reid, the firm supporter of pugilism, backed Richmond for
50 guineas, Mr. Peter Ward patronised old Jack Holmes. They met at
Cricklewood Green, a short distance from Kilburn Wells, where a twenty-one
foot ring had been roped out, on Monday, July 8th [1805]. Paddington
Jones seconded the black, and Tom Blake picked up his old antagonist the
coachman. About twelve o’clock the men stripped and began the set-to.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Holmes stood up well, and
appeared in excellent condition for an old
’un. Much sparring, no good hits.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Both rallied smartly, but no falling.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Richmond put in a good hit, but fell.
(Odds two to one in favour of Holmes.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4, 5, and 6.—Nothing interesting in these
three rounds.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—An excellent round. Richmond was
very gay and full of fight; some good blows
exchanged.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Holmes began to puff, and appeared
distressed in his wind. (Bets, nevertheless,
three to two on Holmes.)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Some sparring. Richmond put in a
severe blow, and cut his opponent under his
right eye, and Holmes fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—No fighting; the men closed, and
both fell. (Betting had now become even.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—The best round during the battle;
both fought well and rallied. Richmond
terminated it by bringing down his opponent
heavily.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Very poorly contested. Holmes could
hardly puff wind enough to support himself,
and he also appeared weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—No fighting. The men closed and
fell, Richmond uppermost. (Odds had now
changed three to one in favour of Richmond.)</p>

<p class='c022'>To the 24th—All hugging rounds, Holmes
upon the saving system.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Richmond appeared in high spirits,
fought well, and evidently had the advantage.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—Decisive. Richmond stepped in and
immediately knocked Holmes down, and,
although with great reluctance, he was
obliged to give in.</p>

<p class='c022'>The contest lasted thirty-nine minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'>Among the amateurs and professors there
were Mr. Fletcher Reid, Hon. Berkeley
Craven, Thomas Sheridan, Esq., Mr. Upton,
John Gully, Jem and Tom Belcher, Bill
Ryan, Puss the Jew, Tom Cribb, Jack Ward,
and Dan Mendoza.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the 8th October, 1805, at Hailsham, Sussex, Richmond met Tom
Cribb, for a stake of 25 guineas. He never dared to face his man, and after
a wretched merry-andrew burlesque of an hour and a half gave in, see <span class='sc'>Tom
Cribb</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 246.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c009'><sup>[148]</sup></a> This affair seems to have taken the conceit out of
Mr. Richmond, for he only appears as a ring attendant and follower until
1808, a period of nearly three years, when we have an account (on April 14,
1809),<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c009'><sup>[149]</sup></a> of his beating “a countryman named Carter from Nuneaton, near
Birmingham, on Epsom Downs.” As this is given on no other authority, that
we can discover, than that of Pierce Egan, we quote him <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipsissimis verbis</span></i>:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>“Carter was much the strongest and a heavier man than Richmond; and
who in a turn-up with those heroes of the fist, Jem Belcher and Jack Gully,
had convinced them both that he was no trifler; and now having expressed
his fancy for a mill with Mr. Richmond, Bill without hesitation informed
Carter that he should be accommodated with a trial of skill. Paddington
Jones and Bob Clarke seconded Richmond. Upon setting-to the odds were
seven to one against the man of colour, and in the fourth round the odds ran
so high against Richmond, that twenty to one was sported that Carter won
the battle, and ten to one that Bill did not come again. This great odds was
occasioned by a severe blow that Richmond received on the side of his head,
that rendered him nearly senseless; but Bill soon recovering from this
momentary disadvantage, showed off his science in such good style, that
in the course of twenty-five minutes, Carter was so punished as to resign the
contest. Immediately upon this being declared, Richmond jumped over
the ropes, and caught hold of a man denominated China-eyed Brown,
threatening to serve him out (if he had not been prevented), as it appeared
that Brown had loudly vociferated, during the time Richmond was suffering
from the effects of the above blow, that Bill had got a white feather in his
tail! Richmond was patronised upon the above occasion by Sir Clement
Brigg, Bart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We next have upon the same authority, “In seconding a baker a few
months after the above circumstance, near Wilsden Green, a man of the
same trade, weighing close upon seventeen stone, challenged Richmond on
the spot, when a turn-up commenced, and in about two minutes the baker’s
dough was so well kneaded, that he would have no more of it at that time;
offering to fight Richmond for £50 in a month, which was agreed to by Bill,
and two guineas put down to make the bets good before that period; but the
baker, it appeared, preferred losing his two quid than submitting his overgrown
carcass to the punishment of Richmond.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bill fought a man of the name of Atkinson, from Banbury, at Golder’s
Green, near Hendon, a bargeman, for a subscription purse; it was a good
fight, but in the course of twenty minutes Atkinson was perfectly satisfied
the chance was against him, and acknowledged that he was beaten.”
“Boxiana,” vol. i. 443‒5.</p>

<p class='c007'>It does not appear from Richmond’s next legitimate match after his defeat
by Tom Cribb, that our sable friend’s prowess was in very high esteem, for
his next battle, Tuesday, April 11, 1809, was fought for ten guineas, at
Coombe Wood, near Kingston, with “one Isaac Wood, a waterman,” who
has no other chronicle in the chronologies but this black defeat. However,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Pierce answers negatively for his “not being unacquainted with science,”
and his “determined spirit.” The contemporary report is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“At one o’clock the combatants arrived in post-chaises; a twenty-five feet
ring was immediately formed, and at half past one the heroes entered, and
set-to; Richmond seconded by Jones and Bob Clarke, and Wood by Tom
Cribb and Cropley.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—A little sparring. Richmond
threw in a left-handed hit on his opponent’s
jaw. Wood rallied, but was thrown. (Odds
seven to four on Richmond.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Wood hit; Richmond parried, and
returned right and left. The men closed,
and both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—A good round. Wood rallied; some
good hits exchanged. Richmond displayed
great superiority in science, and again threw
his opponent. (Odds two to one in his favour.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Richmond made play, and successfully
planted a right-handed hit. Wood attempted
to rally, but Richmond parried
both right and left, when Wood was so
much abroad, that he was milled round the
ring, and thrown over the ropes. (Odds
four to one on Richmond.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Wood made play, and rallied courageously.
Hits exchanged at half-arm for
half a minute, to the advantage of Richmond,
who closed, and threw Wood again.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Wood’s head now appeared dreadfully
disfigured. Richmond rallied, but Wood
evinced great weakness and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Both rallied, and Richmond threw
Wood.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Somewhat in favour of Wood. Richmond
made a false hit. Wood struck twice,
and then threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Richmond, in making play, slipt.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Both stood up manfully, and hit at
full length until both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—In this round Wood displayed good
bottom, but no science. An excellent rally.
The men closed, and Richmond fibbed Wood
until he was covered with blood, and both
fell weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Wood appeared as though he had
exerted his last effort in the last round.
Richmond threw in three successive blows
in the face, rallying him to the ropes, when
he gave a somersault over him.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—In this round Richmond threw his
opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—This round, although not the last,
was decisive. Richmond again put in three
successive hits on the head. Wood attempted,
but was evidently unable to return,
and Richmond threw him. Wood with great
courage, but evident disadvantage, stood up
to the</p>

<p class='c022'>23rd.—When Richmond again brought
him down, and he was unable to come to
time. Richmond was very little hurt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another battle was fought between Frere and Power, which in twenty-five
minutes was decided in favour of the latter, who possessed the greatest science.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richmond had always suffered in reputation from his first display with
“the veteran” Maddox, and anxious to retrieve his credit, he was continually
carping at the “old ’un,” and proposing matches. George, who
was brave as a lion, at last agreed to risk his established reputation, and
100 guineas of his backer’s money, to accommodate his old antagonist, and on
the 9th of August, 1809, in his 54th year, was defeated as hereafter reported.
The battle was fought at Pope’s Head Watchhouse, on the coast between
Margate and Reculvers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A twenty-seven feet ring was formed with ropes, and the heroes,
without loss of time, entered and set-to; Maddox seconded by Gully and
Bill Gibbons, and Richmond by Bob Clarke and Jack Ward. At setting-to
odds six to four on Maddox.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Maddox went in as usual with
great gaiety; Richmond stopped him, and
planting two successful blows on the neck,
brought him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Maddox rallied, and threw his opponent
over the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—An excellently contested round, in
which Richmond displayed great superiority,
both in science and strength, and after good
fighting threw his aged adversary with a
force which astonished every spectator.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Maddox evidently fought at great
disadvantage, but stood up courageously.
(Odds were now changed in favour of Richmond
four to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>The bravery of Maddox, however, spun
out the battle for fifty-two minutes, and he
displayed as much game as, perhaps, ever
was seen. Within a few minutes of the termination
of the contest, when quite blind,
he was on his knees, and by a sudden effort
he sprung up, and holding Richmond round
the neck with one hand, continued to deal
out some tremendous hits with the other,
but nature was at length exhausted, and he
fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>George was liberally rewarded for his
prowess by a subscription. This was the
battle which the Right Hon. William
Windham eulogised in a speech in Parliament,
which we have quoted already at
pp. 90, 91.</p>

<p class='c013'>Richmond, having thus “fed fat his ancient grudge,” appears merely as a
second in several leading events. Having quarrelled with Power, when seconding
“Uncle Ben” (Burn) against Dogherty (see <span class='sc'>Ben Burn</span> in Appendix), the
following turn-up took place, of which we find the record in “Pancratia,”
p. 334‒5. We extract it as a specimen of the state of society, which, with
all our advocacy of legitimate pugilism and a fight in its proper time and
place, or when necessity and self-defence compel it, we should be sorry to
see restored.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On May 1st, 1810, a large party of amateurs and pugilists, amongst
whom were Gully, Jackson, Richmond, Dogherty, Cribb, and Tom Belcher,
dined at the Castle (then called Bob’s Chophouse), in Holborn. After the
cloth was cleared, several sporting theatricals being present some capital
songs were sung, and the bottle circled freely. Some excellent sparring
was then exhibited by some of the first professors, and at length it was
agreed that a subscription purse of £20 should be made by the company
present, and immediately fought for by young Cribb and Dogherty. Tom
Cribb seconded his brother, and Richmond, who is handy on all occasions,
seconded Dogherty; betting even. Cribb displayed great gluttony, threw in
some excellent hits successfully, and often rallied and beat away the superior
science of his opponent; but at the end of an hour, being quite exhausted,
gave in, when Dogherty was declared the conqueror. Both combatants were
several times hit off their legs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the termination of this battle, Power, who was originally intended
to have contested with Dogherty, but could no where be found, came in, and
another purse was subscribed to the same amount for him and Richmond.
An honourable baronet and Cribb seconded Richmond, and an amateur
Colonel and Bill Gibbons, Power.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>“Richmond having seconded the preceding battle for an hour, set-to
with great disadvantage, and for the first round had the worst of it, but,
as every amateur might have expected, his science gave him the best of the
remainder. Richmond excels in hitting and getting away; and Power, who
is a resolute fighter, was continually boring in upon his opponent, and this
sort of game always gets a man the worst of the battle with such an opponent
as the black. By this system Power was completely beat in a quarter of an
hour. He was frequently hit twice in the face in a second, and frequently
brought down by a favourite left-handed hit of Richmond’s, who, on the
other hand, received no other injury throughout the battle than a slight
blow in the face. Forty shillings out of the purse consoled Power for his
bad fate; and Richmond sat down to his wine £18 richer, and with the
amateurs toasted fighters and fighting till three o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Richmond now became a publican, at the Horse and Dolphin, in St.
Martin’s Street, and as he was a shrewd fellow, his house was well
frequented.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richmond acquired considerable notoriety from his patronage of Molineaux;
and, so far as we can learn, his generous behaviour to that pugilist,
who came to him an entire stranger, destitute of friends or money, received
an ungrateful return. It is certain Molineaux was indebted for that
patronage and attention which he afterwards received from persons of
distinction, to his introduction by Richmond.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richmond, after the contest between Molineaux and Carter, April 2, 1813,
challenged either of them for £100.</p>

<p class='c007'>Five years had nearly elapsed since Richmond had exhibited in the P.R.,
when, to the astonishment of many, he declared his intention of contending
for the first purse of 50 guineas, given by the Pugilistic Club, at Coombe
Wood, on Tuesday, May 3, 1814. Everything was conducted with appropriate
attention congenial to the patronage bestowed upon the occasion,
which was much more conspicuous than hitherto. The members of the club
were dressed in their uniform (blue and buff); and those persons who were
appointed to clear the outer ring wore dark blue ribbons in their hats, to
designate their appointment, tending to prevent any sort of confusion,
because, at other times, men so acting have been challenged with officiousness.
The stakes and ropes were entirely new, and upon the former the
initials of the club (P.C.) were painted. Three ropes went round the ring,
which was twenty-four feet. Davis, a fine, tall, powerful, young, athletic
navigator, had thumped his way into notice, by serving seven or eight
customers with tolerable ease; his weight was twelve stone ten pounds, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>his age twenty-four years. The veteran man of colour, who dared him to the
conflict was twelve stone two pounds, and in his fifty-second year! Davis
entered first; he threw up his hat, bowed to the spectators and was well
received. Richmond soon followed, paid the like attention and was equally
applauded. Their seconds now began to perform their office, Joe Ward and
Dick Whale for Davis, and Tom Belcher and Bill Gibbons for Richmond. It
was a sunny day, and the toss for the shady side was won for Richmond. A
few minutes after one the set-to commenced.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—From the well known science
of Richmond, and his peculiar forte of hitting
and getting away, considerable interest was
excited. Davis being under the guidance of
the veteran Joe Ward, it was presumed by
the fancy that the navigator would be made
awake to the dangerous mode of his antagonist,
and be on the alert not to be cut up
and spoiled before his powers could be fairly
brought into action. Davis did not want for
confidence; he made a good hit with his
left, which was stopped by Richmond, who
also returned right and left, but without
material effect. Davis, anxious to make a
beginning, and full of vigour, followed up
his man, and planted a smart hit on Richmond’s
temple with his right, which knocked
him down instantly. (Betting took a lift,
and seven to four was loudly vociferated
upon Davis.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Spirited exchanges, and some heavy
blows passed. Richmond drew the cork of
his antagonist; nevertheless, the man of
colour was again levelled. (Two to one was
sported upon Davis, in the exultation of the
moment, by his friends.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Richmond began to show off the mastery
of the art; milling the nob of his antagonist
severely, and getting away; Davis,
with much resolution, bored in, when, after
closing, both went down, Richmond undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Richmond rallied in fine style, and
with his left hand put in a most tremendous
blow, which irritated Davis so much, that
he suffered his passion to get uppermost, and
rushed in furiously, but, his distance being
short, Richmond went down from a slight
touch of the mouth. Davis bled profusely.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The skill of Richmond in this round
burst forth so conspicuously, that the doubtful
were satisfied of his superiority. Confident
in himself, and with science and
courage united, he nobly opposed a rally,
and got away with uncommon dexterity,
punishing the head of Davis most terribly at
every retreating step. The navigator, in
pursuing, threw nearly all his blows away,
when Richmond, quite unexpectedly stopped
short, and planted so severe a teazer on the
mouth of Davis that sent him quickly on the
grass. (Even betting.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Davis, from the severity of the last
hit, was unable to gain any advantage over
Richmond, who again took the lead in high
style, milling and dropping his antagonist.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—The manner of Davis was much
altered, and he appeared distressed. His
temper forsook him, and he still kept boring
after Richmond, who milled him in every
direction, and at length put in so tremendous
a blow upon his jaw, that, in his confusion,
he made blows without any sort of direction,
till he hit himself down under the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Davis, in a rally, hit Richmond slightly
on the mouth; the latter kept punishing his
adversary severely, and getting away. In
closing, Richmond went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—The inferiority of Davis was apparent.
In science he was by no means competent,
and his strength was much reduced by the
skill of his opponent. Richmond continued
his retreating system with great success, and
put in so weighty a blow under the ear of
Davis, that he was instantly down.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—This round was of little importance;
the men closed and fell, but Richmond
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Richmond completely spoiled his antagonist.
Davis was going in to smash the
Black in haste, but met with such a stopper
right in the wind that completely changed
his course: he reeled again. Davis now
closed, and endeavoured to throw Richmond,
which he accomplished, fell upon his latter
end, his head rolling towards the ground,
distressed beyond measure.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Had Davis possessed the strength of
a giant, it must have been exhausted by the
mode in which he fought. Notwithstanding
the severe remembrancers he had received
in the preceding rounds, he had gained no
experience from them, but still kept following
Richmond all over the ring, hitting wide
and losing himself. The Black kept punishing,
but received nothing; retreating, retreating,
and retreating again, and at almost
every step made woeful havoc on the nob of
his adversary, completely showing the spectators
what might be accomplished by scientific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>movements. At length he suddenly
made a stand, and, his distance proving
correct, with his right hand hit the mouth
of Davis with such uncommon severity, that
he went down like a log of wood. (Numerous
betters, but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—It was plain that Davis was nearly
finished; he appeared stupid, and his efforts
were feeble. Richmond put an end to the
combat by sending him partly under the
ropes. Davis could not come again.</p>

<p class='c022'>Upon Richmond’s being declared the conqueror,
he leaped over the ropes, which were
nearly five feet in height, with the agility of
a tumbler. He received little hurt, except
a blow on the temple, and a slight touch on
the mouth. On the contrary, Davis was so
dreadfully punished that he was supported
off the ground. The battle continued twenty
minutes. Richmond remained on the ground
during the sports of the day, without inconvenience
from this conflict.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was scarcely imagined, from the advanced age of Richmond, that he
would ever fight any more prize battles; and upon a battle being announced
between the man of colour and the navigator, Tom Shelton, great surprise
was manifested by the amateurs at the vast disparagement between them;
the latter pugilist being little more than half the age of Richmond, and
possessing all the advantages of youth, strength, and science. It, however,
created so great an interest in the sporting circles, that on Tuesday, the 1st
of August, 1815, upwards of ten thousand persons assembled on Moulsey
Hurst to witness the trial of skill. Oliver and Painter seconded the veteran
nigger, and Cribb and Clarke waited upon Shelton. It appears this battle
originated in a quarrel between the combatants; and so strongly did it
operate on the feelings of Shelton, that he positively refused to comply with
the usual custom of shaking hands with his opponent previous to their
setting-to. But upon the champion’s declaring he would instantly quit
the ring if he did not, Shelton laid hold of Richmond’s hand, and the fight
commenced, the odds being six and seven to four on the man of colour.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Shelton, from his eagerness to
be at work, missed his adversary in making
a blow, and Richmond also hit short; but
the man of colour soon planted a severe
blow with his left hand, when Shelton, with
great readiness, damaged one of Richmond’s
peepers so sharply that the claret was seen
trickling down his face. Shelton, full of
resolution, fought his way into a rally, which
was well contested, and the navigator was
thought to have the best of it. Richmond
went down from a hit. (The betting immediately
changed, and even was the order of
the day.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Richmond, anxious to return the favour
he had received, planted a hit so clean and
dexterously upon Shelton’s mouth, that the
claret followed, like drawing the cork of a
bottle. Shelton positively appeared electrified,
and went down like a log. (Two to one
offered upon the man of colour.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The right eye of Richmond was terribly
puffed. Shelton had the best of the
rally, and his aged opponent went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—The veteran was all alive, Shelton
showed good science, but seemed determined
that nothing less than downright milling
should go on; he made a good right-handed
blow. Richmond missed a desperately aimed
hit at his adversary’s ear, which was attributed
to the bad state of his own eye, and in
closing, got down in an easy style.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The navigator got into work successfully,
and felt for Richmond’s head and body
not very delicately; but the man of colour
again touched him on the sore place of his
mouth. The advantage of this round was
evidently with Shelton, and he sent his
opponent down. (The odds now rapidly
changed, and two to one was loudly offered
upon the navigator.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Richmond found that no time was to
be lost, and to win in anything like his usual
style the fight must soon be taken out of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>adversary. He, with much judgment, planted
a tremendous blow with his right hand upon
Shelton’s nob, who instantly went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Both combatants on their mettle, and
reciprocal punishment. The man of colour
went down. It was altogether a good round,
and a sharp rally took place.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The passion of the navigator at length
prevailed over his judgment, and he went in
furiously, regardless of the consequences.
This conduct rendered victory almost certain
to Richmond, who planted so desperate a
blow on his opponent’s throat that he went
down almost senseless.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Richmond set-to with increased confidence
from the success of the last round,
but, after a short rally, in closing, both
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Shelton, full of pluck, attacked his
opponent with much gaiety, when Richmond
got down from a slight blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Richmond appeared the fresher man
of the two; but little execution on either
side. (The odds, however, were upon Richmond.)</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Shelton slipped on setting-to, and
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—The man of colour seemed well assured
of his own superiority. He hit Shelton
right and left so tremendously, that he
went down in a twinkling. The partisans of
Richmond thought it quite safe, and offered,
without hesitation, two to one upon him.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—The discretion of Shelton was now at
an end, and he was furious in the extreme.
He completely bored Richmond off his legs.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Richmond, in making a hit, over-reached
himself, and went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Richmond was again on the grass.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—This round was decidedly in favour
of Richmond, who not only milled, but threw
his adversary.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—It was distressing to see the punishment
Shelton brought upon himself, from
the rushing system he pursued. The right
hand of the man of colour was at work like
a sledge hammer.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—The combatants soon fought their
way into a sharp rally, when Richmond
made some good hits and got down.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Richmond went down rather unsatisfactorily,
and some marks of disapprobation
were expressed; but the umpires did not
deem it worthy of attention.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—The man of colour now completely
satisfied the spectators of the advantages of
hitting and getting away; and this destructive
system, to an adversary who will suffer
himself to be decoyed by it, was completely
exemplified by the dreadful punishment
Shelton received. Some murmurings occurred
about a foul blow; but the umpires
did not stop the battle. (Any odds upon
Richmond.)</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—It was plain that Shelton could not
last much longer; he went down from a
heavy blow upon one of his eyes.</p>

<p class='c022'>23 and last.—Richmond now had it all his
own way, and, with the utmost <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>,
planted so tremendous a hit upon Shelton’s
temple, that he went down. The effects
were so severe that he appeared quite
stunned, and when “time” was announced,
could not quit the knees of his second. The
battle continued twenty-nine minutes and a
half. Richmond, elated with the success of
victory, jumped out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c022'>By this victory the man of colour added
another laurel to his wreath; and although
he did not escape without some punishment,
he won the battle in good style. Shelton’s
impetuous passion completely ruined him;
and it was observed by a noble lord that
Richmond was “a most extraordinary man,
for the older he grew the better he fought!”</p>

<p class='c013'>This was Richmond’s last regular appearance in the P. R., yet his rooms
in Whitcomb Street, Haymarket, were highly patronised by the nobility and
gentry; and about this period Lord Byron became acquainted with him,
as may be seen in his lordship’s Life and Journals edited by Thomas Moore.
His athletic form, though fast approaching threescore years of age, his
civility, self-control, and temperate habits, compelled the respect of all
who knew him; and that “still beneath the snow of age slept the fire
of youth” was well proven by a casual affair, in which the veteran man
of colour was involved by the violent conduct of Jack Carter, then known as
the “Lancashire Hero,” and aspiring to the championship of England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The latter pugilist had lately returned from the Continent, intoxicated by the
applause he had received at Aix-la-Chapelle, and he had “crept so much into
favour with himself,” that he annoyed several companies he went into with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>his vast prowess, and his challenge to fight any man in the world. This
conduct he carried to such excess on Thursday evening, November 12,
1818, at a respectable tavern in the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane, that
the company rose in a body and put him out of the room by force. The
degradation of being thus ousted, raised his choler that he roared out, “Is
there any one among you dare face Jack Carter?” Richmond, who was
present, answered that he did not fear him, whereon Carter defied him to a
bout, and a turn-up commenced, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans ceremonie</span></i>, in the yard belonging to
the house, where three bustling rounds took place. The report is from
“Boxiana.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Science was not much in request.
A few random hits, however, were
exchanged. In closing, Carter endeavoured
to weave the man of colour, and, in going
down, Richmond had the worst of the fall.
Carter held Richmond so fast, that his
friends were obliged to pull the man of
colour away; in the struggle the buttons of
Richmond’s coat were floored. Upon the
Lancashire hero getting up, the claret was
seen trickling over his mouth.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—This round was full of bustle; in fact,
it was pummelling and hugging each other;
but Richmond was not idle, and had the
best of it till they went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3 and last.—This was the quietus; and
the man of colour was not long in putting in
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i>. Carter seemed confused,
when Richmond planted one of his desperate
right-handed hits (for which he was so distinguished
in the ring) upon Carter’s upper
works, that not only loosened his ivories, but
produced the claret, and floored the late
hero of Aix-la-Chapelle like a shot. He
laid stunned for a short period, when, once
more feeling the use of his legs, he exclaimed,
“I’ve been finely served out this
evening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus ended the skirmish, and Carter retired, weeping over the stupidity
of the fracas and folly of intemperance. “Oh that men should put an enemy
into their mouths to steal away their brains!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Richmond returned to his company to finish the evening with the utmost
nonchalance over his sober heavy wet, with no other damage but knocking
up his right hand a little.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richmond was an active, excellent second, and, from his temperate mode
of living, preferring exercise to wasting his time or injuring his constitution
by a too frequent repetition of the charms of the bottle, obtained the character
of being a good and steady trainer, and, notwithstanding the defect in one of
his knees, excelled as a cricketer.</p>

<p class='c007'>In concluding this sketch, we cannot omit stating of our hero that in
private life Richmond was intelligent, communicative, and well-behaved;
and, however actively engaged in promulgating the principles of milling,
never so completely absorbed with fighting as to be incapable of discoursing
upon any other subject; in fact, he was rather facetious over a glass of
noyeau, his favourite wet with a swell, and endeavoured to gain his point by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>attempting to prove that there is more certainty in his preservation of bodies
(in allusion to his method of training) than either the cobbler or parson have
in their taking care of the “soles!” He had much more to say than many who
style themselves “amateurs,” but was never known to be so deficient in
eloquence as when Molineaux experienced defeat. His experience in life
taught him to be awake to the tricks of it, and there were few subjects upon
which Richmond was not capable of conversing. It could never be denied
that he “wore a head;” and although its colour did not prepossess the
million in its favour, yet the liberal part of mankind will acquiesce with
Desdemona, that “the visage” may be often best “seen in the mind!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Richmond may be pointed to as one of the men who never lost sight of the
situation in which he was placed in society. In the elevation of the moment,
he always bore in mind that, however the Corinthian fancier may connect
himself with milling, there are times when he has a different character to
support, and must not be intruded upon. Would that many of our whitefaced
boxers would take a hint on this point from Bill Richmond, the Black.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus respected and supported lived Bill Richmond, till the universal
visitor, grim Death, gave him his final summons, on the 28th of December,
1829, at the house now occupied by Owen Swift (the Horse-shoe Tavern),
Titchbourne Street, Haymarket, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>GEORGE COOPER—1812‒1825.</h4>

<p class='c013'>The pugilistic position of George Cooper at one period placed him in the
very first rank. He was a pupil of Paddington Jones, and afterwards a particular
favourite with Bill Richmond, who declared him “the best natural
fighter” he had ever met with.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cooper was a native of Stone, in Staffordshire. His height, five feet ten
inches; his weight, twelve stone. On the other hand, his constitution did
not come up to his other qualifications. He trained badly; and, being a
temperate man, seemed really better in his <em>physique</em> when left alone than
when subject to systematic diet and discipline. In fact, George Cooper, as
Captain Barclay most expressively termed it, “trained off,” instead of “on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cooper’s first appearance in the prize-ring ropes was on the 15th of
December, 1812, at Combe Warren, with Harry Lancaster, for a subscription
purse of 85 guineas. On this occasion George was seconded by his tutors,
Paddington Jones and Bill Richmond; Lancaster was waited upon by Jack
Lancaster and Cropley. From the superior boxing capabilities of Cooper, the
contest was over in seventeen minutes and a half. Lancaster had, however,
not only the length of his opponent, and equal weight, but possessed the
advantage of standing over him. Lancaster commenced milling with much
gaiety, and endeavoured to nob Cooper in a sharp rally, but the latter stopped
his onset with great neatness, and ultimately floored him. In short, throughout
the fight, Harry had but little chance of success, although he planted
several severe blows on Cooper’s head. The steadiness of Cooper, the excellent
use he made of both hands, the science he portrayed in stopping, and
the quickness and severity of his returns, were the admiration of all present.
Lancaster could not once take the lead, and retired from the ring with heavy
marks of punishment.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_p302a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>GEORGE COOPER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Cooper derived considerable fame from this first attempt, and he was next
matched as a competent competitor for Tom Oliver, for a subscription purse,
at Moulsey Hurst, on May 15, 1813. It was a truly determined battle (see
life of <span class='sc'>Tom Oliver</span>, Period V.), and at one period of the fight, his superiority
was so great, that it was thought almost impossible for Cooper to lose it;
however, one tremendous blow defeated him. The victory seemed as if
stolen from Cooper, so nearly did it appear within his grasp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cooper now entered the lists with Jay, on the termination of the battle
between Painter and Oliver, at Shepperton Range, on Tuesday, the 17th of
May, 1814, for a purse of 25 guineas, given by the Pugilistic Club.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the first appearance of Jay, at Rickmansworth, when he defeated
Fuller, it was thought that he bade fair to obtain a high position on the roll
of pugilistic fame. His unquestionable strength, firmness of position, and
severity of hitting, were great traits in his favour; and, even in his second
contest with Fuller, when he experienced a reverse of fortune, and was compelled
to yield to superior science, he claimed respect for his great gameness.
In the hands of Cooper, however, Jay appeared a mere commoner, and few
traces of his former milling were visible. In the short space of eight
minutes he was punished out of all conceit of himself and the purse, declaring
he had had enough, while Cooper retired from the ring with scarcely a
scratch on his face. The spectators were completely astonished at the finishing
qualities of Cooper. It should, however, in fairness, be stated that Jay
felt so much depression at his defeat by Fuller, that he took no care of himself,
and was never afterwards in anything like condition to enter the prize
ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after the above battle Cooper went to Scotland, where he opened a
school for teaching the art of self-defence. At Edinburgh, in particular, his
conduct was much praised: it not only gained him many patrons and
backers, but his school was well attended.</p>

<p class='c007'>A match was proposed between Cooper and Carter for £100 a-side, both
being at Edinburgh; but it went off in consequence of the bad state of health
of the former. It was generally supposed that this would have proved a
fight of great equality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The patrons of pugilism, anxious to witness a prize battle in Scotland,
entered into a subscription purse for that purpose, to be fought for by Cooper
and Molineaux. This mill took place at Corsethill, Lanarkshire, March 10,
1815. Early in the morning the fancy were on the alert, and not a drag or
a nag was to be had in Edinburgh by nine o’clock. Thousands pedestrianised
it before daylight, so as to arrive in time, and numbers, it seems, went on a
wrong scent and sailed for Inchkeith. At half-past twelve Cooper and
Molineaux appeared in the ring, and at fourteen minutes before one, shook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>hands and set-to. Oliver and a Yorkshireman seconded Cooper; and Joe
Ward and Richmond picked up Molineaux. Six to four on the black.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Silence prevailed, and the
Caledonians appeared anxiously interested
to witness the opening attack. Considerable
sparring took place, both being aware of the
milling talents possessed by the other. Molineaux
commenced offensive operations right
and left, and Cooper, in return, put in a
sharp bodier, but, in slipping, received a hit
which sent him under the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Milling without ceremony, and both
the combatants on their mettle. Molineaux
planted a sharp nobber, but received for this
favour two tremendous rib-roasters, that
made him wince again and gasp for breath.
Some blows were exchanged; in closing,
both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Molineaux, with the most determined
spirit, kept fighting at his opponent’s head;
while Cooper directed most of his blows at
the body. Some heavy hits passed, and, in
a desperate rally against the ropes, the
claret was first observed upon Cooper; however,
the round was finished to his advantage,
for he hit the man of colour through
the ropes. (Seven to four upon Cooper.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Molineaux appeared at the scratch
rather distressed from the last round. Cooper,
full of gaiety, took the lead, and floored
Molineaux in grand style. (Two to one on
Cooper.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The superiority of Cooper was conspicuous.
He stopped the fury of the Black
with skill, nobbed him at will, and again
hit the man of colour down. (Any odds on
Cooper.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Molineaux was growing weak. Cooper
having the best of him, eventually put in a
tremendous facer, which floored the Black
like a shot.</p>

<p class='c022'>7 to 9.—In all these rounds the best of
the fighting was decidedly on the part of
Cooper. Molineaux was hit down every
round.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—The Black, still determined, rallied
Cooper against the ropes, and some hard
fighting followed; but Cooper planted so
desperate a blow on his opponent’s body,
that he went down quite rolled up, his head
falling against the stake.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Molineaux, despite his defects and
falling off, astonished the ring from the
gallant manner he fought this round. Some
terrible exchanges of blows were witnessed,
when the Black again rallied Cooper to the
ropes. In closing, Molineaux was severely
fibbed, but broke from his antagonist cleverly,
and ultimately floored Cooper by a heavy
blow upon his face. From great exertion,
however, Molineaux fell exhausted. This
rather reduced the odds.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Cooper appeared at the scratch eager
to finish the Black, whom he nobbed repeatedly,
and completely hit off his legs.
The man of colour was sick, and brandy was
given him to recruit his declining spirits.
(Any odds, but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Molineaux was sent down as soon as
he toed the scratch.</p>

<p class='c022'>14 and last.—The Black could scarcely
leave the knee of his second, and, upon
meeting his man, he was again floored.
The battle was thus at an end, twenty
minutes only having elapsed.</p>

<p class='c022'>From the superior style of Cooper in this
battle, he rose high in the opinion of the
Scotch fancy, and, on this occasion, he entered
the ring in good condition. Molineaux
trusted principally to his weight and length,
neglecting any preparatory care of his
health, so that the right-handed body blows
of Cooper proved irresistible. The tourney
was well conducted, and afforded a high
treat to the northern admirers of boxing.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few months after the above battle, while on a sparring tour in Ireland,
a match was made between Cooper and Dan Donnelly, the champion of
Ireland, which took place on the Curragh of Kildare, on the 13th December,
1815, as noticed in the memoir of Donnelly. Cooper, after a desperate
struggle, was defeated. The advantages of size and weight were much on
the side of Donnelly.</p>

<p class='c007'>In June, 1816, Cooper returned to England, when it was expected a match
would have been made between him and Harry Harmer, but, in consequence
of not meeting with a customer of any description, he once more directed his
steps towards his patrons in Scotland, where he was again well received and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>liberally patronised. He was at length matched with Robinson (a man of
colour) who had gained considerable notoriety from two contests with the
Lancashire hero, Carter—particularly the latter one, a match against time
(half an hour)—although defeated in both instances. The Caledonian fanciers,
like the metropolitan high-bred swells, were all in motion at an early period
to witness this black and white game, and an unusually strong muster of
amateurs of all pedigrees, from the laird of broad acres to the more humble
“bonnie chiel,” were seen “trotting along the road,” so great was the
anxiety to view these heroes of the “London ring” exhibit their acquirements
in self-defence. Considerable betting took place previous to the fight;
but whatever opinions might have been entertained by the patrons of pugilism
in Scotland respecting the milling qualities of Robinson, it should seem the
more experienced ones in England viewed the match in question as a certainty,
and booked it Cooper must win in style. They asserted that Robinson
had no peculiar boxing trait to rely upon, nor even a shadow of chance,
except from superior strength. Anticipation, in this instance, was justified
by the event; for Robinson was beaten off-hand, with the same ease that
Cooper disposed of Jay.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Monday, the 24th of February, 1817, the men entered the ring, at one
o’clock, attended by their respective seconds, in a twenty feet ring, at
Costerton Houghhead, about fourteen miles from Edinburgh, for a purse
of fifty guineas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The style of Cooper proved a perfect treat to the Scotch admirers of
boxing. His superiority was evident upon lifting up his hands, and putting
himself in attitude; before the first round was finished all the spectators
were perfectly satisfied what must be the result of the battle. It would be
superfluous to detail the minutiæ of the rounds, short even as they proved,
being only seven in number. Robinson, in the hands of Cooper, appeared
no more than a fresh-caught novice,—indeed, George treated the capabilities
of the man of colour with the most mortifying contempt; punished him
severely in all directions, put in hits on every part he aimed at, and concluded
every round so finishingly as to receive loud and repeated applause.
Poor Robinson could only stop his opponent’s blows with his head or carcase,
and only in one instance did he make anything like a successful return. He
was floored every round; and it was universally admitted, that if Cooper
had possessed that primary requisite for a fighting man, sound stamina, he
would have been an equal competitor for anything either upon the Scotch or
English list. From this elegant display of Cooper, the gentlemen composing
the fancy, both south and north of Carlisle, felt anxious to back him against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>any one of his weight. It was remarked as somewhat curious, that Oliver
beat Cooper, and Carter defeated Oliver; and again, Cooper conquered Molineaux,
and Molineaux proved the victor in his contest with Carter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cooper, from the union of his superior practical knowledge of the art
of self-defence and civil deportment, rendered himself an object of attraction
in Scotland. As a teacher, he was well patronised; and, in consequence,
fixed his residence for a time in that part of the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cooper, not meeting with any professional adversaries in Scotland or England,
thought he might as well endeavour to pick up a little blunt in foreign parts;
but whether George received his mission from the Champion, Tom Cribb,
who took the chair<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c009'><sup>[150]</sup></a> at the meeting to take into consideration the propriety
of sending representatives of the fancy to “Congress,” we have not been able
to ascertain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course we have a right to suppose that Cooper, Carter, and Gregson,
were among the “Ayes,” on this motion of the Champion’s, as appears from
the following account:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the Great Hall, at Aix-la-Chapelle, Cooper, Carter, and Gregson, in
the month of October, 1818, exhibited before Prince Metternich, Prince
Charles of Prussia, the Prince de Solms, and a number of Russian and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Prussian general officers and foreign noblemen, who repeatedly cheered the
‘assaults’ between Carter and Cooper, and Gregson and Carter.” These
heroes also went to Liege, in their way to Cambray and Valenciennes, and
thence to Paris.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is a literal translation of their advertisement, which appeared
in a French paper, published at Aix-la-Chapelle:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“MM. Carter (Champion of England), Cooper, and Gregson, the first English boxers,
being now at Aix-la-Chapelle, have the honour of informing the public that, on Wednesday,

at the same hours, they will exhibit two grand sets-to, in boxing, in the Hall of Vieille-Redoute,

<p class='c013'>The editors of continental papers, then, as now, knew very little of the
principles on which British pugilistic contests are conducted. In one of
the Paris journals the following description of the pugilists at Aix-la-Chapelle,
is given:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Aix-la-Chapelle</span>, Oct. 8.—Yesterday there was a grand exhibition
made by the English boxers. This hideous spectacle attracted but few
spectators. The two champions, built like Hercules, and naked to their
waists, entered the lists, their hands guarded by huge wadded gloves. One
might imagine that he beheld the ancient athletic games of Greece and Rome.
After a severe contest, one of the boxers, more adroit than his rival, struck
him so violent a blow on the breast that he fell, and victory was thus
decided.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On Cooper’s return to London, a benefit was given him at the Fives Court,
but no customer offering to enter the lists with him, he left the metropolis
for Edinburgh. The heroes of the ring viewed Cooper with considerable
jealousy, and murmured much at his having the court granted to him,
observing that he went about sparring, and such a privilege as a benefit at
the Fives Court should only be granted to fighting men. In reply to this
ill-natured assertion, Cooper urged that no one would fight him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>A few months after the above-named benefit Cooper again visited the
metropolis, when he quite unexpectedly had a tremendous turn-up with a
new black, under the following circumstances, to which the remarks already
made on the affair between Richmond and Power are equally applicable. “We
condense from “Boxiana:””</p>

<p class='c007'>For the purpose of making a match between Oliver and Dan Donnelly,
a sporting dinner was got up, among a select few, at Tom Oliver’s house,
in Peter Street, Westminster, on Tuesday May 11, 1819. The head of the
table was graced by warriors, both naval and military, whose country had
felt and has acknowledged their services. At the bottom, the gay little
Scroggins was placed in the chair, supported on his right by Spring,
Donnelly, and Cooper; on his left appeared Turner, Oliver, and Carter.
The latter was in mourning for his recent defeat by Tom Spring, at Crawley
Down. On the removal of the cloth, the “gaily circling glass” was passed
round with bumpers; and the patrons of pugilism and pugilists, were toasted
with due spirit. Things were going on in this pleasant manner, when
Oliver entered, and informed the chairman that a gemman of colour was
below, and wished to be introduced to the company; but having “no card,”
to send up in due form, he begged it might be announced that “Massa
Kendrick, of St. Kitt’s, by way of dessert, offered his services to any of the
milling heroes present.” The chairman, with the concurrence of his friends,
agreed he should be accommodated, and ordered him to wait, and hold
himself in readiness. Donnelly was asked if he would take the job in hand
for ten guineas, but he seemed to think that the first essay of the Champion
of Ireland ought not to be hid in a room, and that the prize ring only would
satisfy the amateurs at large, and prove suitable to his own character. This
objection was considered valid. Carter said he could “lick all the blacks,”
and was anxious to put the blunt into his pocket, but it was thought somewhat
too early for him to have another combat. A noble lord requested
Cooper to give them a “taste of his high quality,” but the latter did not
wish to soil his mawleys for less than a purse of 25 guineas. Scroggins now
begged to be heard, saying “as how, if Cooper fought this here black, he
being such a good fighter, it would not last five minutes; whereas he would
do it for the ten quid, and with him and Massa it must prove a sporting
fight” (bravo! and laughter). In the true sportsmen’s style, a handicap
purse was made, and the £26 5<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> of soft, etc., was produced on the table in a
twinkling. The purse being ready, tables, glasses, decanters, and the good
things of this life, were removed with the celerity of a pantomime transformation,
and a clear stage and fair play announced. Everything being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>ready, Massa Kendrick was introduced. He grinned with delight at the
thought of the 25 guinea prize. He was a tall, bony, athletic chap,
possessed a furious nob, young and strong, about 13 stone weight, and by
no means deficient in pluck. He proved to be the same man who threatened,
at Randall’s benefit, to mill all the “big ones,” at the door of the Fives
Court, and attacked Richmond in the street. He was told if he won he
would have 21 guineas, and if he lost, four. “Berry well,” replied the sable
champion, “see how him’ll win it.” The man of colour was seconded by
Carter and West Country Dick; Oliver and Donnelly attended upon Cooper.
Betting now commenced in this little circle of first-rates, and ten to five
was offered upon Cooper. A gentleman, whose conduct upon all sporting
occasions has been the theme of panegyric, held the watch. The fight commenced
about eleven o’clock, p.m.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On setting to the Black looked
formidable; but, in the opinion of the amateurs,
from the well known excellence and
finishing qualities of Cooper, it was thought
a few rounds would completely satisfy the
ambitious spirit of Massa. The Black, however,
rushed in and hit Cooper, and in closing,
had the latter down, and undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Massa made play, and hit Cooper bang
in the head. In closing, some slight milling
occurred, and both down, Massa undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>3 to 8.—The Black got some ugly props,
but he would not be denied, and rushed in;
both down every round.</p>

<p class='c022'>9 to 11.—In the last named round, Cooper
put in a rare stopper on the head, and had
Massa undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>12 to 14.—Massa hit Cooper down in the
first and last of these rounds. “It’s not
so safe,” was the cry; the courage of Massa
excited some interest, and procured him
friends.</p>

<p class='c022'>15 to 26.—In all these rounds the Black
appeared a troublesome customer, and the
narrowness of the room gave him the advantages
of rushing in and getting Cooper down.
The latter put in some good hits, but the
courage and fighting of the Black were not
reduced; in fact, six to five was offered upon
Massa.</p>

<p class='c022'>27 to 30.—It was evident the powers of
Cooper were under the influence of wine.
His fine science was not seen; his heretofore
desperate hitting not witnessed; and
the rushing blows of the Black, at times
nobbing him, Cooper went down very weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>31 to 34.—The right hand of Massa was
continually at work, and he punished Cooper
considerably about the head. This last
round was severely contested. Cooper could
not get his distance to make a hit, the Black
bored so much upon him. The claret was
now running down Cooper’s face; he, however,
got a turn, and sent Massa down.</p>

<p class='c022'>35.—Cooper made some hits; but the
Black sent him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>36 to 40.—In some of these rounds Cooper
planted a few hits, but they were not effective.
The Black disregarded them and took
the bottle to drink. Cooper fell from a blow
much exhausted. Some long faces were to
be seen; indeed, so confident were some of
the amateurs present, that Cooper was backed
at odds that he won it in a quarter of an
hour, but these bets had long been decided.
The Black was now taken, that Cooper did
not beat him in fifty minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'>41.—The Black put in a tremendous
smasher on Cooper’s nose, the claret appeared,
and he went down distressed.</p>

<p class='c022'>42 to 50.—Massa was yet strong; and the
encouragement of “Bravo!” and “The
Black must win it,” and “I’ll have the
Black for £100,” gave him greater confidence;
and he not only continued rushing,
but had the best of it. He hit Cooper down
severely.</p>

<p class='c022'>51 to 53.—These were sharp rounds, but
Cooper could not turn the chance against
him, and great alarm was felt by his friends
that the man of colour would, ultimately
triumph. Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>54.—The Black was severely thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>55.—Massa confidently went up to his
opponent and paid away with his right hand.
Some sharp exchanges followed: but Cooper
received so severe a nobber, that he fell
down and turned on his face. The Black
was now decidedly the favourite.</p>

<p class='c022'>56.—Cooper had scarcely been seated on
the knee of his bottle-holder ten seconds,
when a gentleman who had backed Massa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>called out, “Time, time.” The umpire,
with much animation, demanded to know
his reason for so doing, as well as pointing
out to him the impropriety of such conduct.
It caused no further interruption. In closing,
Cooper was down.</p>

<p class='c022'>57 to 60.—In one of these rounds Cooper
was heavily hit down. The cognoscenti were
utterly astonished; and the pugilists present
could scarcely believe that the scientific
Cooper was fighting. A novice, completely
unknown to the ring, was positively getting
the best of him, and, to all appearance,
winning the fight. “What are you about,
Cooper?” was the cry.</p>

<p class='c022'>61.—Cooper, it appeared, could not get
away; but he now drew back, and with his
right arm met Massa right in the middle of
his canister as he was furiously coming in,
and the Black was floored. “That’s the
way to win it, Cooper!”</p>

<p class='c022'>62.—The fumes of the wine were slowly
evaporating, and the film removing from
Cooper’s eyes. In fact, he appeared to recollect
himself, and mentally to exclaim,
“Cooper’s himself again!” The last nobber
seemed rather to have spoilt the Black’s
distance, and he now hit short. Cooper
again canistered him, and the ogles of Massa
rolled with astonishment. It was a small
touch of electricity, and the Black was not
proof against the shock. In closing, both
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>63 to 65.—Cooper’s quality now began to
peep out a little; and Massa appeared not
quite so lively, from the severe hits he had
received in these rounds. The Black did
not relish this change in his fortune; and
he indicated to his seconds something like
“enough!” Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>66.—The Black made a miss, and napped
a facer; he missed again and again, and his
nob paid for it. The campaign had now
changed, and “Cooper for £100,” was the
cry.</p>

<p class='c022'>67.—Massa was hit down.</p>

<p class='c022'>68.—Cooper began now to recover the use
of his arms, and he exerted them to some
purpose. The Black was met at every point,
and finally sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>69 and last.—The Black still showed fight;
but got such a bodier, besides punishment
upon his upper works, that when time was
called he did not answer the sound, and
victory was declared in favour of Cooper.
Massa tried to leave his second’s knee, but
dropped exhausted. The Black did not show
much punishment, except one of his eyes,
which was rather damaged; but Cooper was
heavily damaged about the head. It occupied
an hour and five minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The Black was certainly a
troublesome customer, and weighed above a
stone heavier than his opponent. Indeed, the
event was doubtful for a long time; but, in all
probability, had the combat taken place in
the ring, and with the advantages of training,
Cooper would have made a short reckoning
of it. It should be recollected, Massa came
prepared, and Cooper was taken by surprise
from the table, late in the evening, and
primed with wine. Massa put on his clothes,
received the four guineas, and walked home.
The Black hit well with his right, and it was
thought this turn up might have led to a
regular match, Massa being rather fancied
by some of the amateurs present, who urged
that if he was sent out to nurse, his victualling
office put into commission, with the
advantages of patronage, and the improved
effects resulting from training, he might then
be capable of making a good stand against
any one of his weight. The previous fame
acquired by Cooper suffered considerably by
this hasty combat.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Black, although defeated, gained a few friends; and a purse of £50
was offered to be given to Cooper and Kendrick to have a ring fight; but
the former, much to the surprise of the sporting world, declined it, observing,
“It would be of no use to him; it being his wish and intention to fight a
boxer of some note, defeating Kendrick would not add to his reputation.”
This answer was not well received, it being thought by the amateurs, that
the £50 would be like a gift to George Cooper. At Shelton’s benefit at the
Fives Court, on Tuesday, June 22, 1819, the set-to between Cooper and
the Gas Man, claimed universal attention. It was fine science against confidence
and boring, or, in other words, sparring versus fighting. Cooper
stopped almost every hit, and gave Gas some severe nobbers in return. His
attitude and mode of setting-to were pronounced beautiful. The man of Gas
gave in in consequence of “hurting his hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From the superior abilities displayed by Cooper in this glove bout, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>minds of the amateurs were made up decidedly in his favour. It was
however, afterwards asserted that the Gas Man “gammoned it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the Minor theatre, on Tuesday, May 25, 1819, when Donnelly, Carter,
and Cooper, took a benefit, the following circumstance tended to raise the
scientific acquirements of the latter still more highly in the estimation of the
public.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon Randall’s appearing on the stage as a spectator, there was a general
cry of “Randall, Randall;” and the Nonpareil immediately gratified the
wishes of the audience by entering the lists with the accomplished scientific
Cooper. From the well-known excellence of both the men, a great treat
was expected, and most certainly an extraordinary trial of skill was
exhibited. Cooper was extremely unwell; nevertheless, the elegance of
his manner, the admirable stops he made, the peculiar style of bobbing
his head aside to avoid the coming blow, his fine position, either to protect
himself or to give the assault, and his formidable hitting at out-fighting,
claimed the admiration and praise of every one present; and much astonishment
was expressed how a novice (the Black) could have mauled him so
much in their recent turn-up, without he had been “how came you so,”
indeed. This set-to was also a fine opportunity for Randall to show his
pugilistic perfection. He was here opposed to first-rate talents, and he
proved himself a Nonpareil indeed. In addition to the superior skill of
Cooper, Randall had also weight and length against him. Randall, though
not so showy and elegant as his opponent, proved equally effective; he
stopped with much adroitness, hit with his antagonist, and put in a little one
now and then with a nicety of eye that showed he suffered not the slightest
opening to escape him. In the last round, Randall exhibited the severity
of his peculiar style of in-fighting, with which the combat closed. Thunders
of applause compensated the combatants for their exertions. Such an
exhibition of the art of self-defence is not often witnessed; for it is only
in placing men of similar talent against each other that interesting exhibitions
can be made.</p>

<p class='c007'>In July, 1819, Cooper, in his cards of address, informed the public that
in consequence of his not being able to get a customer, to fill up his time he
was giving practical illustrations on the art of self-defence, at his rooms, in
Cateaton Street, for a short time, previous to his return to Edinburgh.</p>

<p class='c007'>A match was now proposed, for £100 a-side, between Shelton and Cooper,
but owing to some trifling obstacles it went off for that year, when Cooper,
in company with Donnelly, set out on a sparring tour to Manchester, Liverpool,
Ireland, Edinburgh, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Early in the spring of 1820, George returned to London, and lost no time
in communicating his intentions to the amateurs of once more entering the
prize ring. Therefore, on Tuesday, March 7, Cooper appeared at the Fives
Court, at Shelton’s benefit, when he mounted the stage and thus addressed
the audience:—“Gentlemen, I have come from Edinburgh to London, not
for the sake of sparring, for I mean fighting, and nothing else (bravo!) I
will fight Shelton for from £100 to £200, and give him his own time; and
I will also fight any man of my own weight in the kingdom for £50 a-side
in three weeks.” Shelton immediately accepted the challenge.</p>

<p class='c007'>This public declaration of Cooper’s put him “all right” with the amateurs:
and betting commenced briskly upon the event. The match for £100 a-side
was made on the Friday evening following, at Shelton’s house, the Bull’s
Head in Cow Lane, Smithfield, to come off on Tuesday, June 27, 1820, in a
twenty-four feet ring; a deposit of £20 a-side being put down.</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of Cooper’s also giving a challenge to any man of his
weight in the kingdom, to fight for £50 a-side in three weeks, a match was
proposed to Hickman (the Gas Light Man) to enter the lists with Cooper.
Both the combatants meeting at the Royal Tennis Court, at Cy. Davis’s
benefit, on Tuesday, March 14, Hickman said he had no objection to it,
provided Cooper did not weigh more than he did. Upon reference to the
scales, it appeared that the Gas Light Man was the heavier by a quarter of a
pound. Mr. Jackson guaranteed a purse, the contest was decided upon,
and both men went into training.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Tuesday, the 28th of March, 1820, Hickman and Cooper fought at
Farnham Royal, near Dawney Common, contiguous to Stowe House,
Buckinghamshire, twenty-four miles from London, immediately after Martin
and Cabbage had left the ring. The current betting was two to one upon
Cooper on setting-to; but, to the astonishment of the good judges, Hickman
proved the conqueror in the short space of fifteen minutes. This surprising
contest will be found detailed in the memoir of <span class='sc'>Hickman</span>, in Period V.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding this unexpected defeat Cooper satisfied the amateurs
that his game was as good as his science; and, as a proof that he had not
lost the patronage of the sporting world, his benefit at the Fives Court, only
two days after the battle, was well attended. Cooper took the money at
the door, his head tied up with a handkerchief, and exhibiting marks of
tremendous punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was whispered about, that in consequence of this defeat the match
would be off between Cooper and Shelton, and the £20 down forfeited; but
as another proof that George had not lost the confidence of his backers, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>money, £100, was made good with the greatest alacrity. Shelton, however,
was the favourite, at six and five to four, and unusual interest was excited
throughout the sporting world.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Tuesday, June 27, 1820, an intensely hot day, the ring-goers, great
and small, again had a sporting day. The attraction to that delightful spot,
Moulsey Hurst, to witness two such pugilistic stars as George Cooper and
Tom Shelton was indeed great. The weather, it is well known, can never
deter the thorough-bred admirers of pugilism and life; who among the fancy
in those palmy days of the ring, could miss such a treat? or who could deny
himself the sight of the bustling scene of life so graphically described in the
lines appended?</p>

<p class='c007'>Cooper, since his defeat by the Gas Light Man, had rather lost ground in
the estimation of the amateurs; and Shelton was decidedly the favourite, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>six and five to four. But the odds were reduced on the night previous to the
battle, and the takers had the majority. The Hurst displayed a fine show of
the Corinthians. At five minutes after one, Cooper, dressed in a smock
frock, entered the ring, and threw up his hat, followed by his seconds
Belcher and Harmer. Shortly afterwards Shelton also threw up his hat,
he was attended by Randall and Spring. The betting was guineas to pounds.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On stripping, Shelton appeared
in the highest condition; so careful and attentive
had he been to the rules of training,
that it was asserted a glass of spirits had
not passed his lips for the previous four
months. Cooper looked pale, and his backers
wished that he had had the advantage of
one more week’s training; still it was observed
that George was never in better fighting
trim. On setting-to both combatants
appeared equally confident. After eyeing
each other for about a half minute, and
dodging to obtain a good opportunity to
plant the first hit; Shelton tried to put in
one, two, but without effect. He then followed
Cooper close into the corner of the
ring (in the style of the Gas Light Man, but
without his execution), and after some exchanges,
in appearance rather to the advantage
of Shelton, both went down in a close,
Cooper undermost. (Loud shouting, and
“Go along Shelton; that’s the way, my
boy!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Cooper, with the utmost dexterity, put
in a tremendous hit with his right hand on
the ribs of his opponent, and broke away
without getting any return. This blow was
so terrific as to make Shelton bend like a
bow. Cooper repeated the dose, and got
away. Shelton now pursued Cooper, and
made a hit; but in return received a flooring
blow under his left eye, that not only
produced the claret, but he turned and fell
on one knee. (Cooper’s partizans were
roaring with delight, “You’re sure to win
it, George.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The fine science of Cooper now burst
forth, and another ribber was the result, the
agony of which was seen in Shelton’s face.
The latter, however, administered some
severe punishment when in-fighting till both
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Caution on both sides marked the
commencement of this round. The hits
were tremendous; but Shelton at in-fighting
had the best of it; he also gave Cooper
so severe a nobber, that he in turn went
round and fell. (“Bravo, Shelton; it’s all
right.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Shelton could not protect his ribs, and
another dreadful hit upon them was the
consequence; he was again screwed up, as
it were, and Cooper got away. Shelton,
however, in most courageous style, returned
to the attack, and planted a tremendous
blow on Cooper’s face. Cooper staggered
and went down. (Five to three on Shelton,
and tumultuous applause.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—The fighting on both sides was excellent,
till the men got to the ropes in a close,
when fibbing was resorted to by both in
turn. Shelton kept punishing his opponent’s
nob; while Cooper was giving pepper to the
body and ribs of Shelton. Cooper, by a
desperate effort, jumped up and hit Shelton
in the face. Both went down, their nobs
exhibiting severe punishment.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—The superior fighting of Cooper in
this round claimed the admiration, and obtained
cheers from all parts of the ring.
He not only ribbed his opponent heavily, and
broke ground, but stopped Shelton (excellent
fighter as the latter showed himself) in
a style that astonished the oldest amateur.
In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—To say that Shelton did not show
game of the first quality, or that the bottom
displayed by Cooper was not equal to anything
ever exhibited in the prize ring, would
not be doing these brave fellows common
justice. The latter again hit, stopped, and
got away cleverly; still Shelton stuck close
to his opponent, and made many good stops.
At the ropes more fibbing was attempted,
when Cooper held Shelton’s hands, till both
went down. (Well done, both sides.)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—This round was truly singular. The
counter hits were so dreadful and effective,
that both of the combatants were beaten to
a stand-still. They hit each other away for
about two yards, and were so distressed
that they kept their situations, looking at
each other, without being able to move forward,
or to make a blow. They at length
recovered a little, being too manly to go
down, and scrambled towards each other
to the ropes, when both went down. (Great
applause, and “They’re out-and-outers,”
was the general cry.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—This was also a fine manly round.
Hit for hit was exchanged till both were
quite exhausted, when Cooper went down.
Shelton fell upon the latter, with his knees
on his chest.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Shelton, as if determined to spoil the
fine science of his opponent, set-to so sharply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>that he completely out-fought himself, and
fell exhausted. (“He’s going, George; you’ve
got him.” Fifteen minutes had now elapsed.)</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Cooper put in a tremendous facer,
and got away. Shelton, anxious to lose no
opportunity, followed his man, and exchanged
some hard blows. Cooper slipped
down, but in losing his balance, he gave
Shelton a severe nobber. (The odds had
now completely shifted, and Cooper was so
decidedly the favourite, that two and three
to one were offered with confidence.)</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—It must be confessed that Shelton
was a fine fighter; a good hitter with both
his hands, and parried in a masterly style;
and in this round he showed great knowledge
of the pugilistic art. Cooper received
a dreadful stomacher, that almost vociferated
“Bellows to mend.” The latter, however,
sparred till he recovered himself. Shelton
cleverly stopped a mischievous nobber, and
a terrific rally ensued at the ropes; Shelton
was so much exhausted, that he almost laid
himself down. (Great applause, and “Cooper
must win it.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—This round was short, but decisive.
Shelton went down like a shot from a blow
on the head. The best judge in the fancy,
and whose opinion is nearly law, concurred
in the general sentiment, that “it was all
over.” (Three to one a begging, and no
customers to be met with.)</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Shelton, in the most tottering, pitiable
state, reached the scratch. “His face
bespoke a heart full sore.” The heat was at
this time 90 degrees in the shade, and Sol’s
burning rays seemed positively to pour down
liquid heat. Many of the spectators were
compelled to quit the ring, to avoid fainting.
Let the reader, then, picture to his imagination
what must have been the distressed
state of the combatants. Cooper was too
languid to follow up his success, and the
energies of Shelton were spent. A sort of
pushing took place, when Cooper slipped
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Cooper came up to the scratch improved
in strength, and had the best of the
hitting; in going down, he fell with his
whole weight upon his opponent. (The partizans
of Cooper opened their mouths, and
loudly offered four, and some six, to one,
with nearly as much confidence as if the
battle had been won.)</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Shelton, all but gone, went down
quite exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Cooper’s nob exhibited severe punishment,
and Shelton, upon commencing this
round, appeared a little better. Two heavy
counter hits on the head followed, and it
was altogether a sharp round. Cooper was
completely turned by a hit. In struggling,
both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—After some sharp exchanges at the
ropes, on which Shelton was hanging,
Cooper might have finished the battle, but
he held up his hands and walked away, and
Shelton went down. (“Bravo! that’s noble.
Who would not respect true courage, and
admire the English character?” were the
general observations of the ring.)</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Shelton recovering; both down in
the corner of the ring, and Cooper undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—This was a truly desperate round.
The men again hit each other away—stood
still for a few seconds, but could not proceed;
both were too game to go down.
Severe fibbing at the ropes finished the
round, till both fell. Cooper had the worst
of it.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—The nob of Cooper was clareted in
profusion. He came to the scratch feeble;
and, after two or three blows, nearly laid
himself down. (“Here’s a change!” was
the cry, and Shelton again the favourite.)</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Cooper was soon down. Shelton,
from the lead he had taken in the last three
rounds, seemed quite an altered man. He
took the bottle out of his second’s hand, and
drank some water, and, in a scrutinizing
manner, turned round to look at the distressed
situation of Cooper; he seemed, from
the smiling state of his countenance, to
think that “it was all right.”</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Sharp work; but Cooper down.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—The latter made some good hits, but
was sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—Cooper getting extremely weak, but
his science never deserted him, and he made
some hits tell before he got down upon the
turf. (Four to one on Shelton.)</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—This round was completely Shelton’s
own. Cooper received all the hits, one of
which, in the mug, was enough to finish any
man in such a languid state; he went down
exhausted in the extreme. In consequence
of Shelton’s commencing this round rather
quickly, in the Gas style, Belcher called out
to the umpires to observe that both of the
men set-to from the scratch. The umpires
immediately attended to the request, and
cautioned Shelton. (Shelton for almost any
odds, but five and six to one might be had in
any part of the ring.)</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—This round showed the advantages of
science in perfection. Cooper was so far
gone that he seemed not to have a hit in
him. Shelton, like a good fighter, perceiving
that the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i> was necessary, and
no danger to be apprehended, from giving it,
went boldly in to pepper his opponent, and
put an end to his troubles; when, strange to
say, the guard of Cooper was so fine, that he
parried off all the force of his opponent’s
blows, till he fell from mere exhaustion.
(“Bravo! Cooper; you’re an excellent
man.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—Shelton made some good hits, but
Cooper stopped “beautifully,” till he again
felt the turf. (Seven to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—It was expected another round would
finish it, from the exhausted state of Cooper.
The latter fought like a hero, but received a
facer, staggered, and fell. (“It’s all up—he
can’t come again.” Ten to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>31.—The intense heat of the sun still continuing,
so added to the languor of Cooper,
that it seemed almost impossible he could
appear at the scratch. George, nevertheless,
made some hits, and stopped with great skill;
yet he got the worst of it, and was sent out of
the ropes. (Any odds on Shelton, and “Take
him away, he can’t win it!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—How fallible is often the judgment of
the multitude! Cooper, to the astonishment
of every one present, lifted up the ropes with
his hand, and came into the ring with but
little assistance; while on the knee of his
second the “water of life” was administered
to him, and produced the desired effect.
This was a good round, and Cooper still
showed fight and science. Shelton, however,
made a right-handed hit on Cooper’s face,
and immediately afterwards repeated it with
the back of the same hand. Cooper went
down very weak. Ten pounds to half-a-crown
was offered. While Cooper was lying
on the ground, and he was ordered to remain
in that state by Belcher, Oliver came
to the latter, and begged of him to take Cooper
away, as he had no chance whatever to win.
“Blow my Dickey,” replies Tom; “very
pretty advice, indeed! What! take a winning
man away? Oh, no! we’ll leave it all
to the cook!”</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—Cooper showed fight, till both went
down. (£100 to £5, and £100 to £3, were
offered upon Shelton, so strongly did it
appear to some old betting men that Shelton
must win it.)</p>

<p class='c022'>34 and last.—The conclusion of this round
operated upon the spectators like a well
executed conjuring trick. On setting-to,
some little pushing took place, when
Cooper appeared as if in the act of going
down. Catching the upper rope with his
right, he gathered himself well up, and
making a firm stand, let fly with his left
hand so dreadfully upon Shelton’s mouth,
that he instantly fell (slightly touching the
stake with his head) upon his side, like a
lump of lead. The fight was all out of him.
His seconds, Spring and Randall, with the
greatest alacrity, dragged him up, as it were,
for he had no movement in him. This was
a most interesting moment. Cooper sat on
Harmer’s knee, and as Belcher was wiping
him with the handkerchief, half turned
round, watching the appearance of Shelton,
and with a part of his eye directed towards
the umpires and referee, who had all their
stop-watches in their hands, waiting for the
decisive moment to arrive. The anxiety of
Belcher’s face was a perfect study, and his
fingers had almost involuntarily reached his
topper, when “Time” was called; but the
game, the gallant, and unfortunate Shelton
heard not the sound, and victory was proclaimed
for Cooper. It was indeed a proud
moment for him. He lifted up his hands
and waved one over his head, and left the
ring, amidst the cheers of the spectators.
The battle was over in thirty-four minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Cooper proved himself not
only one of the finest fighters on the list, but
as game a man as is to be found throughout
the annals of pugilism. The intense heat of
the sun was enough to annihilate the strength
of a giant. Shelton also proved himself a
first-rate pugilist, with courage of the highest
quality. It was remarked that Shelton’s
two last fights were in the extremes—upon
the coldest and hottest days in the season.
Further comment is unnecessary, as it was
admitted by all persons present to have been
one of the greatest pugilistic treats witnessed
for the previous twenty years. The amateurs
were delighted beyond measure, and
before Cooper left the ring, a gentleman
offered to back him against the Gas Light
Man for 100 guineas.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cooper was severely punished; he, however, did not remain longer in
London than was actually necessary to reinstate him in his health, when he
returned to Edinburgh to take possession of the Britannia Tavern, in Leith
Street.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cooper’s triumph over Shelton so far restored him in the esteem of his
friends, that a second match with the tremendous Gas was loudly talked of
in the sporting circles; and in the month of October, 1820, at a sporting
dinner at the Castle, Tom Belcher posted a £5 note for a second battle,
against the like amount of Hickman’s, to fight for £100 a-side. Cooper at
this time was in Edinburgh; but the money was forfeited on Cooper returning
the following answer, per post:—“Owing to the distance of 400 miles,
which must of necessity be traversed at an inclement season of the year”
(less then a week would not then suffice, be it remembered), “his friends in
the North had advised him to decline the offer at present; nevertheless, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>wished it to be understood that he would increase the sum to £200 a-side,
and meet Hickman in April, 1821. If, however, his English backers desired
him absolutely to come without delay, he would comply with their wishes,
and travel southward immediately.”</p>

<p class='c007'>An amateur who was present at the reading of this letter observed, with
very bad taste, “that Cooper did not dare to fight Hickman;” and Hickman,
following suit, said, “that he would sooner have given 20 guineas himself,
than such a disappointment should have occurred in the sporting world.”
Hickman made sure, according to his own expressions, that he could “beat
Cooper in a canter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of the backers of Cooper having forfeited to Hickman upon
the second match, as above stated, the interest in the sporting world was
much increased when the third match was made for 100 guineas a-side, in
December, 1820, and the battle announced to take place on the ensuing 11th
of April.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cooper arrived in London, from Edinburgh (riding the whole of the 400
miles on horseback), on the 1st of March. From the circumstance of a man
like Cooper, who had been defeated in the short space of fourteen minutes
and a half, leaving a good business at the Britannia Tavern, Leith Street,
Edinburgh, again to meet his opponent, subject to the general opinion of the
fancy against him, he was justly pronounced to be one of the gamest men
alive. The odds were six and seven to four against him. It was, however,
thought by several of his friends, that his “fine fighting” would enable him
to win it; and Cooper was confident in the extreme. During his training,
at Riddlesdown, where he was taken great care of, he had a severe attack
of illness, dyspepsia supervening, and boils breaking out upon his legs; a
sufficient warning, we should think, that he was unfit for the hardy exercise
imposed by training. The battle lasted but two rounds, and in three minutes
our hero bit the dust a second time, from literally a chance shot under the
ear! (See the details in the Life of <span class='sc'>Hickman</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>.) The following remarks
from a contemporary magazine, will show that there was more misfortune
than disgrace in this second defeat:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“It has created considerable surprise among the fancy, that no mark was
left from a blow which effected such terrible execution; but that surprise
must immediately cease, when it is explained anatomically. Had the blow
come in contact with the angle of the jaw, a bruise might have been perceived;
but even a slight hit on the jugular vein is capable of shaking the
brain, suspending the circulation of the blood to and from the heart, and
creating a sort of apoplexy. In like manner a heavy hit on the fleshy part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>of the neck may not leave a mark. Had Cooper been in proper condition, in
all probability it would not have taken so severe an effect. During his
training, ten boils came out on one of his legs, which so crippled him for a
week, that he was compelled to rest it on a chair; and when that leg got
well, boils broke out on the other; in consequence of which an old trainer
(old Joe Ward), advised Cooper to take ‘three sweats’—the doctor also
physicked him on the evening previous to the battle. If his leg had not
been lanced he could not have walked to the ring; and on the morning
of the battle his leg was also dressed half an hour before the fight.” Cooper
was anxious for another trial, and several gentlemen promised to back him.
“If he did not fight Hickman,” he said, “he would not fight any other
person,” as he did not feel himself satisfied, as Pat observed, until he got
“the value of a good bating.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After the unexpected termination of this second encounter, Cooper seated
himself beside the ring to witness the following battle between Collier and
Evans. He was evidently more hurt in mind than body.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cooper now lay by for nearly four years; he repaired to London in the
spring of 1825, where, after a sparring bout, at the Fives Court, with Bill
Eales, at Scroggins’s benefit, on Tuesday, April 26th, he was challenged by
White-headed Bob (Ned Baldwin), and £50 was deposited, to be made
£200 a-side, and to fight the first week in July. The constitutional warnings
above noticed should have deterred Cooper from this contest with a
game, fresh young man, but his spirit said no, and on the 5th of July, 1825,
the scientific George Cooper closed his career in defeat. In this battle nature
deserted him, and he broke the small bone of his right leg, in the 18th round,
by a mere twist of the foot, consequent on the length of the spikes in his
shoes; nevertheless, he came up three more rounds ere he surrendered.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was Cooper’s last appearance; he deserved and retained the respect
of those who knew him best, until his death, which took place at Laughton
Gate, near Liverpool, February 14, 1834, in the 43rd year of his age.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER V.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>TOM SHELTON, “THE NAVIGATOR”—1812‒1825.</h4>

<p class='c013'>This stalwart “navigator,”<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c009'><sup>[152]</sup></a> at one period bid fair for a higher position
on the pugilistic roll than his latter contests assigned to him. He was born
at Wrotham, in Kent, on the 1st of May, 1787, where, when Tom was in the
fourth year of his age, the memorable battle of Tom Johnson and Big Ben
(Brain), took place for the championship. Tom used to say that in his boyhood
this great fight, with its incidents, and the appearance of the champions,
was the frequent theme of rustic talk, and deeply interested his youthful
mind; the spot, often pointed out, being a short half mile from the cottage in
which Shelton first saw the light.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the age of three and twenty Tom found himself in London, and aspired
to boxing fame. In height five feet ten inches, in weight twelve stone seven
pounds, and inured to hard labour by his calling, Tom was “big enough and
heavy enough” for anything. In August, 1812, having made the acquaintance
of Caleb Baldwin, he was matched with Fitzgerald, an Irishman, of
sixteen stone, and six feet and an inch. It was a sharp contest for the space
of fifty-four minutes, when Shelton was declared the conqueror. The
spectators who witnessed the efforts of the Navigator upon this occasion were
astonished at the boxing requisites he displayed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two years, however, elapsed, during which Tom followed his calling,
occasionally looking in at the Fives Court, where on the 31st May, 1814,
at Cribb’s benefit, he put on the gloves as a “novice,” with Harry Harmer.
In this affair Shelton showed so much courage and strength that many
fancied him a match for that skilful professor. He was accordingly backed,
after a long palaver of a twelvemonth, for 100 guineas, and on the 18th
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>April, 1815, on Hounslow Heath, was cleverly defeated, after a most heroic
battle of thirty-five minutes, fighting from beginning to end. (See Life of
<span class='sc'>Harmer</span>, Appendix to Period IV).</p>

<p class='c007'>A Suffolk farmer, of the name of Studd, of superior weight and strength,
anxious to obtain the honours of the ring, was matched with Shelton, for a
subscription purse of twenty-five guineas. The mill took place on Tuesday,
the 27th of June, 1815, at Moulsey Hurst. Harmer and Oliver seconded
Shelton; Studd was waited upon by Richmond and Painter. Shelton was
the favourite, two to one.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The superiority of science was
soon discovered to be on the side of Shelton.
The farmer endeavoured to thrash his opponent
straight forward, and succeeded in
planting two hits, but was awkwardness
itself. A rally took place, in which Studd
got the worst of it, and went down from a
severe blow upon one of his peepers. (The
odds all upon Shelton.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The farmer had no pretensions to
scientific boxing, and bored in without the
slightest judgment. Shelton nobbed him
with the utmost ease, and at length hit him
down. (Four to one on Shelton.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The farmer could not tell what to
make of it. The claret was trickling down
his mug, from the repeated facers he had
experienced, and he was floored from a
right-handed blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Studd was quite abroad, and was sent
down with the utmost ease. (Twenty to one
upon Shelton.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Shelton’s work was all done, and victory
was now certain. Studd, without discretion,
rushed head foremost in; but the
left hand of Shelton paid him dearly for his
temerity, and he was again sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Studd, rather desperate, fought his
way into a rally, and made one or two hits
at random; but Shelton, with the utmost
ease, milled him down. (All betters, but no
takers.)</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Shelton hit his opponent all over the
ring, and sent him down as heretofore.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—On coming to the scratch, it was evident
the countryman could not last long.
He appeared to be much better acquainted
with thrashing corn than entering the prize
ring. This Johnny Raw, it would seem,
had flattered himself that the possession of
strength was the main qualification for
making a win, but he paid dearly for his
erroneous notions. The science of Shelton
rendered him so much at ease, that he
treated the attempts of Studd with the
utmost contempt—he hit him all round the
ropes, and then finished the round by planting
a floorer.</p>

<p class='c022'>9 and last.—The farmer was completely
satisfied that he had no chance whatever,
and resigned the contest. Shelton retired
from the ring without a mark upon his face,
or a blow of any consequence. Studd was
much punished, and his optics in a damaged
state. This combat did not exceed thirteen
minutes and a half.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owing to some private pique, a match was made between Shelton and
Richmond, which was decided at Moulsey Hurst, on Tuesday, the 1st of
August, 1815, in which Shelton was defeated. Shelton, it seems, had
received some instructions from Richmond. See page 298, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after this encounter, Shelton was visited by a severe illness, and so
reduced in weight and strength that it was supposed he would never again
enter the ring. He became a publican, by the aid of his friends, at the Bull’s
Head, Cow Lane (since West Street), Smithfield, but his gambling propensities
caused his failure in this line. In March, 1819, however, the
following battle, which took place on the spur of the moment, tended to raise
Shelton’s fame highly in the esteem of the amateurs. Shelton (who had been
seconding Hickman) was induced to fight a nephew of Ben Burn, the
pugilist, a giant by comparison, weighing nearly, if not quite, sixteen
stone, for a subscription purse of twenty guineas. Shelton was much
out of condition, but on the match being proposed to him, he instantly
accepted it; he however advised his friends to be careful about backing
him. Spring and Richmond seconded Burn, and Oliver and Harmer picked
up Shelton.</p>

<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On stripping, the Yorkshireman
proved indeed a giant; the comparison
between Shelton and his opponent was nearly
similar to the memorable contest between
Perrins and Johnson.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c009'><sup>[153]</sup></a> Although the face
of Burn had no terrific aspect, his bulk was
truly formidable. The spectators expressed
their fears for the result, and the general
opinion was that Shelton had shown more
pluck than judgment, and that he must soon
be disposed of. Upon setting-to, this opinion
was, in a great degree, strengthened. Burn
bored in upon Shelton with confidence, and
the former seemed quite overwhelmed by
this mode of attack, and had no room to
make a hit. The length of arm possessed
by Burn gave him every advantage; he
aimed a dreadful chopper at Shelton’s nob,
which told but slightly. The latter, in a
most singular manner, in getting away
turned round twice. He, however, planted
a facer, but slipped down. (“It’s all up,”
was the cry; and seven to four was offered
upon the “big one,” without hesitation.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Shelton’s left cheek was slightly tinged.
The Giant went to work, and his long arms
did severe execution. Shelton put in two
belliers with great science, and got away.
Burn was awkward, but his length enabled
him to plant a facer that seemed to stagger
Shelton. At length hit for hit took place,
and both went staggering away from the
force of each other’s blows. In closing, the
struggle to obtain the throw was desperate;
but Shelton got the “big one” undermost.
The roar of applause was like the report of
artillery; but still it was thought he could
not stand up against such weight, and must
ultimately be defeated.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—This was a terrific round; it was
downright slaughtering. Shelton put in two
bodiers, that seemed to puff the Giant’s wind
out of his mouth. Hit for hit again occurred,
without intermission; and Shelton received
such a teazer on his left eye, that his nob
was like a spinning top. Burn was almost
beat to a stand-still, and Shelton in no better
plight. The friends of Shelton, however,
now ventured upon even betting, and took
him for choice.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Shelton took the lead in good fighting.
He hit on the body again, and gave Burn
such a rum one on the mouth as nearly
deprived the latter of all his masticators.
The Giant, however, gave Shelton a chopper
on the top of his sconce, that made chaos of
his upper works. Still Shelton, undismayed,
fought like a hero, and ultimately threw his
opponent. By way of encouragement to the
Navigator, it was loudly vociferated, “Shelton
for £100.” If staking had proved necessary,
it might have turned out a mere
flourish.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The mugs of both the combatants
bespoke their handywork. This was a ding-ong
round, and the men fought till they
both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—The strength of Shelton did not keep
pace with his good milling; he was much
distressed, and got to the ropes, Brobdignag
following him with his long chopper; the
punishment was terrific. One of the Giant’s
peepers was almost in darkness; he was also
piping like a worn-out pair of bellows; but
he kept fighting till they both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—This round exceeded all that had gone
before it in severity. The reciprocal facers
were terrific, both of the combatants frequently
going back from the effect of the
blows. Shelton put in most hits, but was at
length sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Shelton commenced with good science,
and nearly floored his opponent’s teeth.
Brobdignag, however, was not idle in returning
nobbers; Shelton, with much dexterity,
after making a heavy hit, instantly
gave a back-hander, that spoiled the shape
of his opponent’s nose. The applause was
loud; but Shelton was sent down: the work
he had to perform before victory was certain
appeared too heavy for him to execute.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Sparring and feints were out of the
question; it was nothing but execution upon
both sides. This round was equal to the
seventh. Both the men stood up and hit till
their strength was gone, when they closed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>and went down. Shelton appeared distressed,
but Brobdignag was also very queer.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Shelton, however, left his second’s
knee first, and appeared at the scratch. He
put in two facers without return, and also
a bodier near the mark; but the Giant,
furious at such treatment, ran in and got
Shelton down. It was thought he hit the
latter unfairly, but it was purely accidental.
“Foul!” “Fair!” etc., were loudly bawled
on all sides; but the umpires did not notice
it. Oliver, with much confidence, now offered
£10 to £2 upon Shelton.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—It was by no means safe to Shelton,
although he came gaily up to fight. Some
sharp work occurred, and Shelton was hit
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>12 and last.—Little Gulliver seemed the
giant in this round, for Brobdignag was hit
to a stand-still. He was quite sick. He,
however, milled as long as he was able, and
Shelton received some heavy blows. In closing,
both went down; but when time was
called, the Giant could not answer the sound
of the trumpet, and victory was declared for
Shelton. It occupied about sixteen minutes.
Shelton gave a dreadful back-handed facer
in this round.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Shelton never took so much,
nor fought better, if so well, throughout his
pugilistic career. To say the least of it, if
calculation or comparison can be admitted,
it was a sort of “nothing venture, nothing
win.” It proved successful, and, with the
many-headed, that is the only touchstone of
all exploits. Shelton not only gained the
purse by the event, but raised himself highly
in public opinion. He won by nothing else
but his good fighting. Burn knew little
about scientific boxing, but acted like a
determined man. Both men were heavily
punished. It ought not to be forgotten that
Shelton had been acting as second to the
Gas man, drinking porter, etc., and was
called into action without any training, and
under every disadvantage. A subscription
was made upon the ground for Burn.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Uncle Ben,” was much disgusted at this defeat of “cousin Bob,” and
found a dozen excellent reasons why he ought not to have lost the fight, so
that Bob was indulged with another “shy,” the money staked, and the day
fixed for Tuesday, June 1st, 1819. Moulsey Hurst was once more the
campus martius, and early on the Tuesday morning aforesaid “the lads wot
love to see a fight” were in motion. Scarcely, however, had the cavalcade
reached Hampton when it was clear from the whisperings of groups, and the
ghastly smile on the face of more than one publican, that a screw was loose.
The only anxiety now was where the mill was likely to take place. The
circumstance of the removal was in consequence of the person who rented the
ferry refusing the London watermen permission to exercise their occupation
in ferrying the passengers over at the last fight, and also in having several of
them fined for so doing; they, in turn, vowed revenge, went to the magistrates,
and laid an information respecting the fight between Burn and Shelton.
This conduct spoiled Moulsey, and Hounslow Heath was immediately substituted.
Considerable betting occurred at all the sporting houses the preceding
evening, and the Giant was decidedly the favourite, 6 and 7 to 4. The ring
being formed at a little after one o’clock, Shelton appeared, followed by Cribb
and Randall, and threw up his hat; and Burn, with his relative Ben Burn,
and Donnelly, entered the ring. Burn threw his topper into the roped
square to answer the challenge, but the wind blew it out to some distance.
This trifling event was considered an unfavourable omen to “Hercules.”
The odds now changed, and Shelton was the favourite, or rather it was
even betting.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On stripping, Burn appeared
in fine condition. Some sparring took place,
and Shelton was rather cautious. The Giant
at length let fly with his right on Shelton’s
body, but it was slight. The latter returned
a bodier with his left sharply, and
immediately planted a tremendous facer that
was heard over the ring, repeated it still
harder, and the Giant went down like a log.
(Great shouting.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The big one appeared a little confused,
and he received another nobber. He now
became furious, and made some hits; but
Shelton repeated the dose severely, and Burn
fell upon his face. (Greater shouting than
before, and five to one on Shelton was
offered.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The Giant made a desperate hit on the
body, and otherwise stuck to Shelton; but
the nobbing system was again adopted by
the latter with success. In closing, both
down, Shelton uppermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—This was a tremendous round, and the
hitting upon both sides was terrific. Shelton
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The superior two-handed fighting of
Shelton astonished the ring. He put in five
facers so sharply, that Burn ran in after his
adversary, and, in falling, hung by the ropes
till down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Sharp exchanges, till Shelton hit down
Burn. It was nothing but downright milling.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Shelton hit the big one staggering
away; he would not be denied, but returned
furiously to the attack, and sent Shelton
down. (“Well done, Burn; Shelton will
soon be on the go.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Shelton broke away in fine style, but
in closing, the Giant fell upon him heavily.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Shelton seemed at work at an anvil,
and closed the left eye of his opponent. He
was, however, undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Burn was hit almost to a stand-still;
but he recovered, and hit Shelton down. It
appeared almost impossible for Shelton to
take the fight out of his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Shelton had worked so hard that he
seemed rather weak, and went down from a
slight hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—The fine science of Shelton made the
Giant quite foam again. He nobbed him
and broke away with the utmost dexterity,
while Gog kept passionately following Shelton,
receiving at every step: the latter ultimately
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—This round rather alarmed the friends
of Shelton; for, although the latter kept
pegging away, he could not keep the Giant
out. He seemed to defy punishment, and
resolutely ran in; indeed, in closing, he not
only fibbed Shelton severely, but, in struggling
for the throw, positively lifted him
half a foot from the ground, when, quite
exhausted, both fell. (“Bravo! bravo!”
from all parts of the ring; and “This is
something like fighting.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Gog plunged in to work, and Shelton
was impelled forward and hung on the ropes;
he, however, extricated himself, and the big
one was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>15 to 17.—The fighting was desperate in
all these rounds; but Shelton, although
getting weaker from his great exertions,
kept the lead.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—The Giant ran in at Shelton, when
the latter stopped him with such a nobber
that he went down on his face.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Burn was drunk from the nobbing he
received, still he returned manfully to the
charge, till both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Shelton’s face exhibited heavy punishment,
but Burn’s head was terrific—it had
been in chancery for the last ten minutes.
The former ran himself down.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—The Giant went down from a hit like
a shot. This blow was given in the body;
the big one’s ogles rolled again, and his
tongue lolled out of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—It was astonishing to see the Giant
recover and come to the scratch. Shelton
had the worst of this round, and received
some dreadful punishment. The odds wavering
a little as Shelton went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Shelton again down. (Even betting;
some fears expressed for Shelton’s weakness.)</p>

<p class='c022'>24 to 26.—Not safe to Shelton in all these
rounds.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—A singular round. Both turned round
and went down. (Two to one on Shelton.)
In this round the latter was again lifted off
his legs like a doll.</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—This round was so well fought by
Shelton, that Cribb roared out, “One hundred
guineas to a farthing—it’s all right.”</p>

<p class='c022'>29 and 30.—In favour of Shelton, but both
distressed.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—Burn so hit that he dragged Shelton
after him as he was falling.</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—This was a well fought round; and
notwithstanding the Giant was nobbed right
away from his opponent, he recovered, and
ran after Shelton, swinging his arms quite
abroad, as it were, and accidentally hit his
man down.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—Shelton got up angry, and was losing
his temper, but his seconds warned him of
his danger. He at length grew cool, became
himself, fought scientifically, and by a tremendous
facer floored his big opponent.
(Great shouting; and “He’ll not fight
another round.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>34.—Notwithstanding the punishment the
Giant had received, his peepers nearly darkened,
his wind did not appear to be bad;
and as for his game, he proved himself a
glutton of the first mould. This was a sharp
round and Shelton, to the astonishment of
the ring, was hit down, although the Giant
appeared quite done up the round before.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>35.—The good fighting of Shelton now
made it quite safe. He put in one, two,
three so sharply on the mug of Burn, that
he went down on his face in a state of
stupor.</p>

<p class='c022'>36.—The strength of Burn’s seconds could
scarcely drag him up to place him on their
knees. It was now Eclipse to a lame donkey;
Gog was floored in a twinkling.</p>

<p class='c022'>37 and last.—Burn was hit down like a
shot, and could not come again. It occupied
thirty-two minutes and ten seconds.
Burn was so dreadfully beaten that it was
some minutes before he was made sensible,
and carried out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Shelton proved himself this
day a superior fighter. He hit with both
hands with a facility that astonished all the
amateurs; and it was thought that not one
on the list, of his weight, could cope with
him. He evinced great game, and was in
fine condition. Burn, too, behaved manfully
in the extreme; more real courage was
never witnessed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shelton was now matched against Benniworth, the Essex Champion, for
fifty guineas a-side, at Southend, on Friday, June 25, 1819, to fight on that
day six weeks. A deposit of £20 a-side was also put down. In consequence
of an accident, which Shelton met with at a dinner given to Bob Gregson, at
the Maid and Magpie, St. Catherine’s, on Tuesday, June 29, it was thought
he must not only have forfeited to Benniworth, but that he never would
have been able to enter the Prize Ring again. The artery of his right arm
was cut across with a rummer. Two surgeons immediately dressed the
wound, and he recovered in a very short time; but the friends of Benniworth
preferred forfeiting the deposit of £20, to risking the event of a
contest.</p>

<p class='c007'>A match of much interest was now made between Shelton and Tom Oliver
(see <span class='sc'>Oliver</span>, Period V.), and Thursday, December 23, 1819, named for the
battle, Copthorne, twenty-eight miles from London, being the rendezvous.
The day proved a deluge, and when the half-drowned wayfarers had reached
Blindlow Heath, twenty-three miles from town, they found that the ring had
been made there. The backers of Shelton protested against the fight taking
place on this spot, to Gibbons, the ring-maker, as being not only contrary to
the order given, but that it was swampy, and surrounded with puddles of
water; that they should proceed to Copthorne, where Shelton had been
moved the day preceding, and they left a communication for the commander-in-chief
to that effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the arrival of the latter gentleman at Blindlow Heath, he sent an
express to Copthorne (which, however, did not arrive till twenty minutes
before two o’clock), for Shelton to return and meet Oliver at the former
place. Shelton declared he was ready to fight anywhere; but his backers
firmly insisted that Copthorne was the place named, and only at Copthorne
should he fight. Upon the return of the messenger to Blindlow, Oliver threw
up his hat in the ring for Shelton to come forward; a ring was also formed
at Copthorne, where Shelton waited till three o’clock for the arrival of Oliver,
but without effect. Thus, singularly enough, there were two rings, but no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>fight. Kendrick and Sutton, a pair of “niggers,” however, sported their
sable skins, and Sutton was the victor.</p>

<p class='c007'>To return to Oliver and Shelton. The men and their friends met at
Riddlesdown, and it was formally agreed to meet at Sawbridgeworth, which
they did on the 13th January, 1820, when, after a desperate battle, full
of fluctuations, Shelton was defeated in fifty-one minutes (See <span class='sc'>Oliver</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The particulars of Tom’s match with George Cooper, and his defeat at
Moulsey, June 27, 1820, will be found in the memoir of <span class='sc'>George Cooper</span>,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 314.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Tuesday, August 18, 1820, at a place called Kit’s Cotty House, about
three miles and a half from Maidstone, a purse of £20 was subscribed for a
match between Shelton and a big navigator; but in consequence of the
latter not appearing in the ring to “show fight” at the appointed time, £10
were given to Shelton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carter had been for a few months in Ireland, on a sparring tour, but,
on his return, he did not seem much improved in purse or person by the
trip. Finding himself in company with Shelton, at a sporting dinner, held
at the Brown Bear, Bow Street, the Lancashire Champion spoke disparagingly
of Shelton’s capabilities; some discussion followed, and twenty pounds being
posted, Shelton replied to the boasting challenge by accepting it instanter.
The affair was short, but by no means sweet to Carter, for Shelton beat him
to a stand-still in three rounds only. This was on the 10th of July, 1821.</p>

<p class='c007'>The renowned Josh. Hudson was next matched with our hero, for £100
a-side; the battle was decided at Harpenden Common, near St. Alban’s, on
the 10th of December, 1822.</p>

<p class='c007'>About a quarter before one, Josh. Hudson, stylishly dressed, with white
silk hose, and his drawers on ready for action, threw his white topper
into the ring with the confidence of a winning man, followed by his seconds,
Randall and Tom Owen. He paced up and down the ring for a considerable
time, when Shelton was called for, but he did not appear. At length
Randall, rather out of temper, said, “It was an unmanly action to keep his
man waiting so long in the cold; and if it was for his money he would take
Hudson out of the ring.” Tom Cribb soon after showed himself, when
Shelton was discovered crossing a wagon, followed by Tom Belcher as his
second. Shelton, in a very cool manner, threw his hat into the ring, and
immediately went up and shook hands with his opponent. The colours,
blue for Shelton, were tied to the stakes by Belcher; and green, for Hudson,
were tied over Shelton’s by Tom Owen. The odds had changed since the
fight was made, and Hudson was decidedly the favourite.</p>

<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On stripping, Hudson never
appeared in finer condition; but the judges
of training observed he was at least a stone
heavier than he ought to be. Shelton was a
complete star; in fact, he could not be
better. His attitude on setting-to was equal
to any boxer ever seen in the prize ring.
Hudson did not, as was expected, “go to
work” <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans ceremonie</span></i>, but viewed his opponent
with much caution, and Shelton was
equally circumspect. The latter, however,
made a feint with his right hand, which fell
short; but this was merely a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</span></i>
for Josh to commence fighting. Hudson
slightly touched Shelton’s ear, when he
went in—a scramble occurred, but no blows
took place. Both went down, and Shelton
undermost. (Loud shouting from the East-enders,
and six to four on Josh.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Shelton smiled, scratched his nob, and
made himself well up for mischief; the
result was, a little pepper on both sides on
each other’s mugs, till Josh, by a severe hit
on the top of Shelton’s nose, sent him off his
balance, and he fell down on his left knee;
but, with considerable game, he instantly
jumped up to renew the charge. Hudson,
however, thought he had done enough, and
sat down on Randall’s knee. (“It’s safe as
the bank,” said Owen; and the East-enders
offered to back their hero to any amount.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Hudson was endeavouring to come
ditto, but Shelton’s right hand stopped him.
It was a severe round on both sides, till both
went down, Hudson undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Shelton’s lip bleeding, showed the first
blood, and Josh’s face was beginning to swell.
The fine fighting of Shelton was conspicuous;
but the youth and true courage of
Hudson would not be denied; and although
the latter napped dreadfully at every turn,
he hit Shelton down. (There was a roar of
roars from the Towerites, and two to one on
Josh.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The fighting now was truly desperate
on both sides; Shelton well-timed his opponent,
and sent him staggering away by
three repeated facers without any return;
yet the goodness of Josh was so high that
he finished the round in great style, and had
Shelton again down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Josh’s face was now cut to pieces, and
Shelton’s in a bad plight; both piping. The
latter turned round from the severity of the
hitting, but once more resumed fighting like
a game cock till both down. (Shouting for
Hudson.)</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Both terribly distressed, but Shelton
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—This was a short round, but terrific
from the execution done. Shelton nobbed
Josh at every turn, and milled him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Josh, like a game cock, disputed every
inch of ground till he went down distressed
beyond representation. (Still his sanguine
friends considered him winning, and offered
two to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—In this round it might be termed
“anybody’s battle;” but the courage on the
one side, and the manliness on the other,
exceeded all praise. Both down. (Five and
six to one on Hudson.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Josh commenced fighting; but his
terrific points were gone, and he began to hit
round. Shelton planted three or four tremendous
facers, the claret following every
hit. Still Josh was dangerous. Shelton
going down, quite exhausted, had the worst
of the ending of the round. (The friends of
Josh were sanguine enough to offer ten to
one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Both in the greatest distress till
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Shelton had the best of the fighting,
but fell on his face exhausted, and Josh
went down quite as bad. Still Josh was the
favourite.</p>

<p class='c022'>14 and last.—The fine fighting of Shelton
rather gave him the lead; and as Josh was
going down in a distressed state, so as to
make it doubtful whether he might come
again to the scratch, Shelton put in a tremendous
blow under Josh’s ear, that rendered
him insensible to the call of time. It
was very doubtful if Shelton could have
fought two more rounds. On the latter being
placed on his second’s knee, he fell on
the ground. It was over in rather less than
fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Such a manly battle had not
been seen for several years. Hudson never
fought half so well before. Had Hudson
proved the conqueror, it was the intention
of his friends to have backed him against
the Gas Man for £500 a-side.</p>

<p class='c013'>A second match with the John Bull Fighter ended in a forfeit, Hudson
receiving £30.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was declared by Shelton that he should never again appear in the P. R.,
and it would have been well for his pugilistic fame had he adhered to his
resolution. Misfortunes, however, in business, had involved him, and at a
meeting at the Ship, in Turnstile, a “big countryman” was mentioned, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>could be backed for a cool hundred against anything in London. Shelton
immediately declared his readiness to try the metal of the stranger, and hence
his match with Brown, of Bridgnorth, wherein he was defeated, though not
disgraced, as will be seen when we come to the memoir of that boxer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shelton had, during the whole of his career, been observed to be
occasionally something more than eccentric; indeed, in 1812, he was indicted
for assaulting a police-officer, who attempted to prevent him from committing
suicide. On this occasion his defence was, that “Any man had a
perfect right to hang himself!” His gambling propensities were also uncontrollable,
and to this his misery may be traced. His propensity to self-destruction
received a final and melancholy illustration, in the fact of his
destroying himself, on the 21st of June, 1830, at the Ship, in Montague
Court, Bishopsgate Street, by taking a dose of prussic acid. He was in his
43rd year.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>JACK RANDALL, “THE NONPAREIL.”—1809‒1821.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps the prize ring in its palmiest day never exhibited a more accomplished
boxer than Randall. Though claimed (<em>after</em> his signal successes), by
the Hibernian portion of the ring press, it appears that his birthplace was the
now-desolated “Holy Land,” and that the 25th of the month of November,
1794, ushered Jack into the semi-darkness of the then foggy region of
smoke, dirt, drabs, and drunkenness, hight “St. Giles’s.” Jack, who was
always called by Pierce Egan and Co., the “prime Irish lad,” himself
laughed, when primed with gin—he would not touch whisky—at his
imputed Irish descent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Archery Ground, in the Long Fields, near where now stands
Russell Square, was the scene of action whereon the youthful Randall
exhibited his prowess. According to the authority of “Boxiana,” young
“Snuff,” well known in boxing circles, was conquered three times by
Randall in the above place; and at the age of fourteen, he fought a man
of the name of Leonard in this ground, who was a stone heavier than himself,
for three-quarters of an hour. Leonard was, at length, so terribly punished,
that he was obliged to be led off the field. Size or weight, it seems, rarely
operated as any drawback to the readiness of Randall; possessing courage
of the first order, his pluck rose superior to the obstacles he had to encounter.
Jack was unavoidably involved, in Marylebone Lane, with a man of the name
of Henshaw; the latter was not only taller, but had the advantage of three
stone in weight. Twenty-five minutes of hard fighting had occurred when
the friends of both parties interfered and made a drawn battle of it. Notwithstanding
the great difference between the combatants, from the superior
style of fighting displayed by Randall, it was thought he must ultimately
have proved the conqueror.</p>

<p>JACK RANDALL, “<span class='sc'>The Nonpareil</span>.”<br /><br /><em>From a Miniature by</em> <span class='sc'>G. Sharples</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>One Murphy, an Irish labourer, an athletic young man, attacked Randall
in Bainbridge-street, St. Giles’s; but the latter, undismayed by his gigantic
appearance, milled Murphy severely in the course of a few rounds. Randall’s
height was five feet six inches, his weight ten stone six pounds. His
appearance when stripped indicated great bodily strength; his shoulders
athletic, inclined to roundness, and his frame, altogether capable of great
exertion, very compact.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first recorded battle in which Randall is noticed was with Jack the
butcher, in the Regent’s Park, Marylebone. It originated in a dispute
respecting some improper conduct in a fight, in which these heroes had acted
in the capacity of seconds, and, being a point of honour, it was decided
instantly. In the course of twenty minutes Randall was declared the
conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall now aspired to higher honours among the pugilistic corps, and,
in the same ring in which Scroggins and Eales had contended, at Coombe
Wood, on August 26, 1815, he made his debut with Walton, denominated
the Twickenham Youth, for a purse of five guineas. Randall astonished the
amateurs with the gaiety of his style, and the decisive action he exhibited.
Paddington Jones and Whale were his seconds upon this occasion; and, in
the short space of ten minutes, the Twickenham Youth, who in other battles
had showed some talent for milling, was so peppered that he left the ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Carter and Robinson had exhibited at Moulsey Hurst the first time,
Wednesday, April 24, 1816, Randall entered the ring with George Dodd, for
a purse of five guineas. It was a well-contested battle, and twenty-five
minutes elapsed before victory was decided in favour of our hero. West-Country
Dick and Clark were his seconds.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Wednesday, May 28, 1816, at Coombe Wood, Randall entered the lists
with a Jew, denominated “Ugly Baruk,” for a subscription purse of ten
guineas, collected on the ground, towards a second fight. The amateurs were
completely astonished at the milling capabilities displayed by Randall; more
especially as his figure appeared so meagre and lank, that an opinion was
generally entertained that “Young Paddy” must in the course of a few
minutes be finished by this determined Israelite. But so opposite was the
result that Baruk, “ugly” as his index had hitherto been declared, was now,
owing to the sudden painting it underwent, not only rendered more
“unlikely,” but so utterly metamorphosed as scarcely to be recognizable.
The decisive qualities of Randall were so conspicuous as to elicit the unqualified
praise of the best judges of scientific pugilism. Randall did not
give the Jew a single chance throughout the fight—he one-two’d him with
surprising celerity, and floored him in almost every round. The battle only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>continued twelve minutes; Randall was seconded by Tom Oliver and Clark.
The abilities of Randall were now the theme of conversation among the
amateurs; but, owing to a bad finger, and want of necessary time to
generally improve his frame, he was not matched till Thursday, April 3,
1817, when he entered the lists with West-Country Dick, for twenty-five
guineas a side.</p>

<p class='c007'>A roped ring was prepared for the occasion, about a mile and a half from
Twickenham, on the Common, and numerous vehicles of all sorts were placed
round it, forming a capacious amphitheatre. Several marquees were also
erected on the ground, filled with the good things of this life, to render the
sports of the day pleasant and attractive to those lads who were “well
breeched;” but such is the uncertain chance of war, that a gentleman who
rode into the ring, having all the appearance of an amateur, unfortunately
turned out to be a county magistrate. He very politely requested the official
characters to remove the ring, and to disperse as soon as possible—a good deal
of persuasion was tried to prevail on him to let the manly sport proceed; but
he was good-naturedly inflexible, and observed, that he had been upon his
horse ever since seven in the morning on the look-out, and that it was impossible
the battle could take place in the county of Middlesex. This was
enough; and, in less than half-an-hour, not a drag was left behind. Bill
Gibbons, Richmond, Harmer, Scroggins, Cribb, etc., repaired to Hayes,
followed by a great party of horsemen and carriages, and formed a ring, but
this ultimately proved a hoax, to the no small chagrin of thousands. The
better informed proceeded to Twickenham, where the subject was again
discussed; and on a signal being given the carriage wheels went round
like lightning, the water was crossed in a twinkling, and on the plains of
Moulsey, in Surrey, about two o’clock, Randall entered the ring and threw
up his hat, followed by Dick. Paddington Jones and Dick Whale seconded
Randall; and Oliver and Clark were counsel for Dick. Two to one on Randall.
Though both combatants were known to the ring, Randall was considered the
better fighter. The spectators were of the first respectability, but not very
numerous. A small delay occurred, owing, it is said, to Dick refusing to
fight out of a roped ring.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On setting-to much caution
was observed on both sides to obtain the
first advantage; Randall, with great dexterity,
put in a sharp facer. In returning,
Dick hit short. Some few blows were exchanged
in favour of Randall, who fought
his way in to a close, and fibbed his adversary
till both went down. (Three to one on
Randall, who had drawn Dick’s cork.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Randall, full of fire, immediately took
the lead, and nobbed Dick so successfully,
that he turned round from his opponent. In
closing, as before, he held Dick up and faced
him till he went down. (Loud applause.)</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>3.—Dick set to with much gaiety, and put
in a body hit, but he could make no successful
impression upon Randall. The latter
not only out-fought him, but again fibbed
him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—The superiority of milling was decidedly
on the side of Randall, who drove
Dick from him. In closing, Dick went down
rather rapidly from the numerous blows he
had received in this round, and it was
thought a foul blow had been given him;
much vociferation took place of “Foul!”
“Fair!” etc.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Randall’s distances were well measured,
and Dick’s nob was again in contact
with Jack’s fist. At the ropes Dick made
an ineffectual struggle to escape from the
severe fibbing which Randall was so liberally
bestowing upon him. (Five to one;
but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Randall commenced work after the
manner of a hammer-man at a forge, and
although Dick kept plunging with his
favourite right-handed hits, yet in closing
Randall held him up with the tightness of
a vice, beating a tattoo upon his mug, till
he felt disposed to send him down. (Loud
shouting.)</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—The left hand of Dick seemed of no
use to him, and his right did not perform
the severe execution it had displayed on
former occasions. Randall, indeed, got
away from it with much adroitness. Dick
was again fibbed down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Randall now satisfied the ring that he
must win; he showed himself a scientific
fighter; he worked well with both hands,
and not only hit Dick away from him, but
ultimately milled him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Dick put in a facer. Randall, in returning,
hit short and went round, but recovered
himself; in closing, fibbed Dick
severely at the ropes, and then dropped him
in style. (Six to one on Randall.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—The nob of Dick was fast losing its
shape from the severe hammering of Randall,
who applied his fist rapidly on his
opponent’s mug. In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—A short round, which terminated in
favour of Randall, as did also the 12th, 13th,
and 14th rounds.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Dick was desperately endeavouring
to effect a change in his favour: he hit
Randall on the face, put in a hard blow on
his shoulder, and had the best of this round.
(Both down.)</p>

<p class='c022'>16 to 20.—Randall seemed rather blown
in these rounds, and at times got away from
Dick’s right hand. In fact he had not been
idle for a moment, and the face of his opponent
gave a strong specimen of his capabilities;
he was fibbed down upon every
set-to. (Five to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—A good deal of sparring occurred
before a blow was exchanged, when Randall
put in four facers without any return. Both
down. (Any odds.)</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—The arm of Randall appeared to have
the activity of a fiddler playing a country
dance; his hand was never out of his opponent’s
face.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—This round claimed much attention
from its singularity. Dick put in two severe
body hits, but in closing Randall fibbed
him severely with his left hand, then changed
it with the most apparent ease, and punished
Dick down. (Great applause.)</p>

<p class='c022'>24 to 27.—In these rounds the spectators
were surprised to see the successful manner
that Randall held up Dick with one arm,
and punished him with the other. His head
was now completely in chancery, his left eye
quite puffed up, and he had been down so
often, as to get the appellation of “Tumble-down
Dick.”</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—The battle was fast drawing to a
close; the excellence of Randall was now
acknowledged by all. Dick endeavoured to
make some desperate hits; but Randall
nobbed him at arm’s length with the utmost
coolness, and in closing did as he liked with
him.</p>

<p class='c022'>29 and last.—On setting-to, Randall, with
much severity, put in a blow on the breadbasket,
that not only puffed the wind out of
Dick, but he went down and instantly rolled
up like a bale of cloth. Such a blow is
rarely witnessed. Time was called, and upon
Dick’s getting up to come to the scratch, he
shook hands with Randall, and resigned the
contest. Time thirty-three minutes and a
half.</p>

<p class='c022'>Randall, in the above contest, proved himself
a good two-handed hitter, but was unusually
successful with his left hand. Dick
had not the slightest chance. Randall left
the ring without a scratch upon his face.</p>

<p class='c013'>The scientific qualities displayed by Harry Holt (See <span class='sc'>Holt</span>, in Appendix),
in a battle of an hour and a half’s duration with Parish, the waterman, and
in his more recent conquest of O’Donnell, at Arlington Corner, had much
prepossessed the amateurs in his favour; and, notwithstanding the excellence
of Randall, it was generally thought that Holt would turn out a worthy
competitor. In consequence of this opinion, a match for twenty-five guineas
a-side was made between the above pugilists. Considerable interest was felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>by the sporting world respecting its decision, which took place at Coombe
Warren, on Tuesday, May 20, 1817, in a twenty-four feet roped ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wet state of the weather in the early part of the morning prevented
great numbers of the fancy from quitting the metropolis, and although it was
extremely fine in the neighbourhood of Coombe Wood, there were not above
six hundred persons present, among whom were Colonel Berkeley, Captain
Barclay, Messrs. Jackson and Gully, Cribb, Carter, Oliver, Scroggins, Crockey,
Ballard, Gibbons, etc. The combatants were nearly alike in weight, both
under eleven stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was upon the whole one of the most orderly conducted matches ever
witnessed, excepting a slight fracas which occurred between Caleb Baldwin
and the keepers of the gate. The latter, not immediately recognizing the
veteran of the ring, refused his vehicle admittance, without the usual tip;
but Caleb, finding argufying the topic would not do—instead of paying them
in sterling coin, dealt out another sort of currency, which, although without
the Mint impress, had such an effect upon the Johnny Raws that the gate
flew open and Caleb rode through in triumph. At a little after one, Holt
appeared in the ring and threw up his hat; Randall immediately followed.
Paddington Jones and Whale seconded the latter, and Painter and Clark for
Holt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The usual ceremony of shaking hands having been performed, every eye
was on the stretch, looking out for the first advantage. Seven to four
generally on Randall, but two to one in many instances.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The combatants had scarcely
placed themselves in attitude, when Randall’s
left hand, with much severity, caught
Holt on his mouth. He repeated it as quick
as lightning, and was endeavouring to plant
a third, but Holt stopped him. Randall
again put in another desperate facer; a few
blows were exchanged, when Randall went
in with his usual sort of hook to fib, but
Holt caught hold of his arm, and a sharp
struggle took place for the throw. Randall
showed the most strength, and Holt was
undermost. (Three to one upon Randall.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—On coming to the scratch in this very
early stage of the fight Holt’s mug showed
the painter had been busy. Randall’s left
hand again successfully nobbed his adversary.
Considerable science was now displayed
on both sides; Holt stopped many
blows in good style, and also planted a sharp
blow on Randall’s cheek. Several hits were
exchanged, but materially to the advantage
of Randall, who, in finishing this round of
three minutes, caught hold of Holt’s ribs in
rather a singular manner, and threw him.
(Three and four to one loudly offered upon
Randall.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Randall, with the utmost coolness,
again beat the tattoo upon Holt’s nob. It
was altogether a long round; but the science
exhibited by Holt was that of stopping instead
of giving, and the spectators were
astonished at the little execution he performed.
Randall put in upwards of six
facers, damaging the peepers of his opponent,
and clareting his face all over, and
sent him down from a tremendous hit on the
side of his head. (Five to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Holt came to the scratch undismayed,
but he had no sooner set-to than
the left hand of Randall dealt out tremendous
punishment. It was never out of his
opponent’s face. Holt, it was now evident,
had been deceived respecting the quality of
his adversary; yet he contended in the most
manly style, and planted so desperate a hit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>under the left ear of Randall that the latter
bled prodigiously. The science of Randall
was pre-eminent; he put in six facers almost
successively; and when Holt at length
stopped him on this boring suit, he used his
right hand with nearly equal success till
Holt went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Randall was compelled to fight extremely
different from the mode he had
adopted with West Country Dick. Holt was
not to be fibbed, and Randall convinced
the admirers of scientific pugilism that he
was a most effective out-fighter. His hits
were tremendous, and Holt’s face was completely
vermilioned. In this round, notwithstanding
the damaged peepers of Holt,
he put in so sharp a blow on the bridge of
Randall’s nose that it pinked his index in an
instant. The quickest eye could scarcely
keep pace with the execution performed by
Randall’s left hand in this round, and he
repeatedly hit Holt from him till he went
down. (All betters, and no offers accepted.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Randall appeared to suffer much inconvenience
from the violent bleeding of his
ear; his mouth was so overcharged that he
could scarcely get rid of it. Had not Holt
possessed excellent science, he must have
been smashed in the very outset of the
battle. He stopped a great number of
blows; but it may be truly said that he only
stood up as a mark to be hit at. It was
curious to observe that, whenever the left
hand of Randall was denied, he used his
right with great facility, and put in some
terrible ribbers. Randall closed this round
by a terrible blow in the middle piece, that
sent his adversary down in a twinkling.
(Ten to one was offered upon Randall.)</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—It was useless for Holt to contend;
but his game and courageous nature prompted
him, if possible, to rise superior to defeat.
It was all up: Randall did as he pleased,
and Holt was again down. (Any odds.)</p>

<p class='c022'>8 and last.—Holt was emulous for conquest;
the blunt, it seems, he did not value,
but the fame of victory was dear to him;
nothing else could have induced him again
to meet his opponent. Randall worked
sharply with both his hands, and with his
right planted a tremendous hit on Holt’s
nob, that instantly floored him. He was
beaten out of time, but was anxious to
renew the combat. He observed, “I am
ready to fight;” but, in endeavouring to rise
from his second’s knee, fell down from exhaustion.
Holt’s friends were perfectly
satisfied he could not win, and he was instantly
carried out of the ring by Parish and
Painter, put into a chaise, and proper attention
paid to him. The battle lasted twenty-five
minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This contest firmly established
Randall’s character as a first-rate scientific
pugilist. He possesses the mastery of the art
in an eminent degree, divests his actions of
sameness with the most perfect ease, and
promptly changes his mode of fighting as the
necessity of the attack requires. In his former
battles with Baruk, the Jew, and West Country
Dick, his superior fibbing traits proved
successful. With Holt a different system
was required, and as an out-fighter he completely
astonished the ring by the terrible
punishing capabilities he exhibited. With his
left hand Randall planted uncounted hits on
Holt’s face, and several with his right. He
threw little time away in sparring; and, like
a good artist, his workmanship soon spoke
for itself. As a finisher there seemed a
great similarity between Randall and the late
Dutch Sam, and as a two-handed hitter, the
decisive mode of Tom Belcher. It was
urged by the partisans of Holt, that he displayed
no fight at all in contending against
Randall. This complaint, upon a slight
examination, will not only soon be removed,
but the assertion proved unjust. Randall
was the offensive fighter throughout the
battle, and his punishment was so rapid
and severe, that he never gave Holt an
opportunity of showing himself, except on
the defensive. The latter, notwithstanding
his science, but in very few instances stopped
his opponent’s left hand. The true statement
of the case is, that “the fight” was hit
out of him as early as the third round. In
fact, if Holt had not been truly a game man,
he could never have stood before Randall for
twenty-five minutes, after the heavy milling
he received at the onset. In consequence of
this opinion being entertained by the few
amateurs present, £10 were collected for his
bravery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Four months had scarcely elapsed when Randall again appeared in the
prize-ring, in competition with Belasco, the Jew. This match produced
one of the most interesting battles upon record. Since the boxing days of
the scientific Tom Belcher and the renowned Dutch Sam, the amateurs and
patrons of pugilism had not been more animatedly interested respecting the
termination of any combat than the one which took place on Tuesday,
September 30, 1817, at Shepperton Range, in a twenty-four feet ring, for
fifty guineas a-side, between these heroes. The milling reputation of both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>the combatants was of the first order throughout the circles of the fancy.
Randall was considered the best finisher of the light weights; the Jews, in
Belasco, hoped to find another Dutch Sam. He was the rising star of their
pugilistic hemisphere, and an awkward man to get at—a desperate in-fighter;
one that would not be denied, and able to rally his opponent to the end
of the chapter. Duke’s Place was all alive in the praise of the capabilities
of Belasco, and, notwithstanding the love of monish by the tribes, it is said, in
some instances, the odds were sported on the promising young Israelite.
But if Petticoat Lane resounded with the strains of the Children of Judah,
on the other hand the back settlements of the Holy Land were equally full
of spirits upon the occasion, and from the turf cutter to the knight of the
hod, all sported all their loose blunt from a sovereign down to a glass of
whiskey, in honour of their “darling Jack Randall.” The Corinthians of
St. James’ too were highly interested in the event; and the flash side
(as they were termed), although they sported five and six to four on
Randall, did not view it with anything like the safety of receiving a bank
dividend. The men appeared in good condition—Belasco weighing a few
pounds more than his opponent, and looking uncommonly fresh. The time
having arrived, five minutes before one, the combatants commenced the attack.
Randall was seconded by Paddington Jones and Dick Whale; Belasco was
waited upon by Little Puss and Aby Swartscher.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Randall, who in all his former
battles generally hit first, displayed unusual
caution. The same care was manifested in
the Jew. It was a complete system of tactics.
The spectators were lost in amazement; and
their optics were completely tired in watching
the feints, viewing the steps, contrasting
the manœuvres, stratagems, and snares resorted
to by Randall and Belasco to get the
best of each other, until nine minutes had
elapsed before the first round was terminated,
during which only four blows had
been exchanged. In closing, Belasco went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The same system of generalship occurred,
and this round occupied eight
minutes and a half. Belasco put in a sharp
hit on Randall’s mouth, which brought forth
the claret in a twinkling. Here the coolness
of the Nonpareil was seen to great advantage;
his steadiness was as if no blow had
been struck. A rally occurred, in which
some sharp hits were exchanged, and Randall
received rather an unwelcome touch
upon his eye. They separated and rallied
again, when, in a close, the Jew went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—From this mode of fighting a long
battle was anticipated. In this round the
knowledge of the art was portrayed on both
sides. Randall was rather unfortunate in
his distances, for although his left hand
bodied his opponent repeatedly, it did not
touch the mark. It was not a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i>.
Belasco down. Twenty-four minutes had
elapsed.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—The conduct of the Jew was much to
be admired. He fought like a hero, and
followed his opponent with all the confidence
of true game. He was, however, floored
with the celerity of a shot, from a desperate
left-handed hit of Randall. The latter put
up his hand to his eye as if it was troublesome.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—It was now clearly seen that Randall
was the great captain; he out-generalled
his opponent with all the accomplishment of
the art of war. If Randall was bored at any
time to a corner of the ring, he fought his
way out with such ease and safety that
description falls short in conveying its excellence.
It was also curious to observe, that
the Jew at one period had got Randall in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>position to fib him, when the latter, from
his tact and courage, not only extricated
himself from this perilous situation, but he
returned the compliment upon Belasco with
unparalleled adroitness, and fibbed the Jew
till he went down. (Two to one upon
Randall.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—A most excellent round in point of
science, but Belasco was again floored.</p>

<p class='c022'>7 and last.—Belasco not only appeared a
better, but a superior boxer in every respect
than in his contest with Reynolds; and if he
could not rank with Randall, he proved himself
a difficult customer to be served. After
some scientific movements, Randall put in
such a tremendous hit on Belasco’s eye, that
the latter instantly put up his hand to feel
if it was there. The pain appeared so excruciating,
that he staggered, fell, and
fainted. Randall might have put in another
hit before he went down, but his conduct
was too noble to add the slightest punishment
to a fallen rival. Upon Belasco’s
recovering from his trance, he rubbed his
body, as if suffering from severe punishment.
The battle thus terminated in fifty-four and
a half minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The most experienced judges
of boxing agreed that throughout the annals
of pugilism such a display of scientific excellence
as the above battle is not to be
paralleled. It was a perfect picture of the
art, and Randall justly acquired the appellation
of “The Nonpareil.” His agility was
surprising. Dutch Sam, in the best of his
days, it was said, never fought with anything
like the precision exhibited by Randall;
and, in competition with the latter,
the Jew phenomenon must have fallen beneath
his superiority. This contest, it is
true, did not altogether please, if we are to
go with the crowd who are partial to
downright milling; but by the admirers of
scientific efforts, by those patrons who value
the intent more than the effect, those amateurs
who appreciate the advantages of
hitting and getting away, of giving instead
of receiving, and of seeing a fight won without
ferocity and gluttony, the fight between
Randall and Belasco may be pronounced one
of the most perfect specimens of pugilism ever
witnessed. The attitudes of the men were
fine in every point of view, and their movements
conducted on the true principles of
science. The athletic beauty of the human
frame was never more prominent. Randall
retired from the ring scarcely scratched.
This is the grand art of fighting—to give,
and not to receive.</p>

<p class='c013'>At a sporting dinner, given to the lads of the fancy at Tom Oliver’s, a few
days after the above fight, by one of the highest amateurs in the scientific
circles, no want of “game,” it appears, was discovered to render the table
complete. When the cloth was removed, the cigars lighted, the lively
glass replenished, and the merits and capabilities of various milling heroes
became the animated subject of discussion among the company present,
a set-to was proposed, by way of practical illustration, between Randall and
young Burke, of Woolwich. The heroes immediately acquiesced in this
request: the gloves were produced, and the men soon appeared in battle
array. Burke, who is five feet ten inches in height, and wanting neither
gluttony nor science, contended for the honour of having the best of it with
much determination; but some doubts having arisen among the learned
judges upon this precise point, a regular glove match was entered into, and a
sum deposited on both sides accordingly. The first clean floorer was to
decide the event! The contest was truly spirited, and after some tidy
milling, Burke went down; but it not being exactly the thing meant, the
point was reserved till another round. Thirteen minutes had now elapsed,
and notwithstanding the advantages Burke possessed from standing over
Randall, the latter at length measured his distance so correctly, that Burke
was floored as if he had been shot! The point being now satisfactorily
decided—the glasses went merrily round—mirth and harmony prevailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>throughout the evening, and the company separated in the utmost good
humour. It is said, that the amateur before alluded to observed that Randall
should not want, if necessary, from 500 to 1000 guineas to complete any
match, so high an opinion did he entertain of his milling talents. Randall
was presented by his backer with the amount of the stakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall had made such rapid strides towards perfection in pugilism that
some difficulty was experienced in finding a customer for him. However,
the long-talked-of match between Parish, the waterman, and Randall was at
length made for 100 guineas a-side. These boxing heroes met on Thursday,
November 27, 1817, at Hayes Common. Parish, it seems, although not
highly appreciated as a boxer, was well-known as a staunch man; he had
also acquired first-rate science, under the tuition of George Head, a teacher
of deserved celebrity. Nevertheless, so little was the Waterman esteemed
in comparison with his opponent, that three to one was the current betting
against him. True, Parish’s battle with Holt was highly spoken of, although
it took him one hour and a half to win it; while Randall, on the other hand,
beat Holt in twenty-five minutes. Wallingham Common, in Surrey, about
six miles beyond Croydon, was the spot selected for this grand trial of skill.
Thither the amateurs repaired at an early hour, but the clergyman of the
parish (also a magistrate) saw the cavalcade pass his window, and hastening
to the ring, declared that the battle must not take place in Surrey. A little
persuasion was tried to divert the rev. gent. from his intention,—but he
observed, “it was loss of time to remonstrate, as he was as inflexible as a
rock.” In this dilemma, Hayes Common, in Kent, about seven miles distant,
was suggested as an eligible place. The stakes were instantly removed, and
the motley group followed like lightning, over a cross-country road, that had
not been visited for months by anything but dung carts or wagons. It was
almost impassable, but the game of the fancy was not to be beaten by trifling
obstacles, and the scene that followed beggars description. Postchaises were
floored in the deep ruts in the road—the springs of curricles and gigs were
broken—the Rosinantes dead beat—the Eatoners puffing and blowing from
top to toe, anxious to arrive in time—boots were dragged off the feet by the
strength of the clay, and many of the light-shod coves stuck fast in the mud.
The magistrate, very politely, saw the patrons of science to the extremity of
the county before he took his leave. At length Hayes Common appeared in
sight, and the ring, after some little time, was again formed. At ten minutes
past three o’clock, Randall appeared and threw up his hat in the ring,
attended by Paddington Jones and Whale, as his seconds; Parish shortly
followed, and repeated the same token of defiance, followed by George Head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>and Spring. Several amateurs of rank were in the ring; and Colonel Barton,
the patron of Randall, sat close to the stakes. After shaking hands the
men set-to and began.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The positions of the combatants
were extremely elegant; both appeared
in good condition, but, if anything, Parish
seemed the heavier man. Neither seemed
eager to strike; and, notwithstanding the
acknowledged excellence of Randall, considerable
time elapsed before the attack
commenced. At length the Nonpareil got
his distance, planted a body hit with much
dexterity, and got away. He was not long
in giving his adversary another, when Parish
returned, but not effectively. Considerable
time again occurred in sparring, till a
favourable opportunity occurred for Randall,
when he let fly at the Waterman’s nob, producing
the claret in a twinkling, and got
away with the agility of a dancing master.
The Nonpareil stopped in a masterly style,
and showed his superiority by finishing the
round in a winning manner. Using both
hands equally, the left being applied to the
body of his opponent, while the right hand
put in so tremendous a hit on the head of
Parish, that he fell forwards on his face.
(Great applause. Eight minutes and three-quarters
had elapsed, and four to one was
offered with as much readiness as if the
blunt was of no value.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Randall, notwithstanding the decided
advantages he had obtained, like a skilful
general, seemed to think discretion the better
part of valour. He was as cautious as if no
blows had passed, and again waited for a
good opening. The attempts of Parish were
frustrated, and Randall, with the most smiling
confidence, again bodied his opponent.
The already damaged mug of the Waterman
was again peppered, and the crimson flowed
copiously. In closing, the Nonpareil showed
himself completely entitled to his appellation;
he got Parish’s head under his arm,
and fibbed him severely till both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The admirers of science were completely
tired before any work was attempted,
so much time elapsed; and the downright
partisans of the old school of fighting, when
milling was the order of the day, began to
treat this sort of boxing contemptuously. In
fact, Parish was so fatigued that he put
down his hands. At length the combatants
became more in earnest, and Randall finished
the round most successfully. He planted a
severe throttler, when Parish returned, but
not heavily. Some blows were exchanged,
and the Waterman so cleanly hit one of
Randall’s peepers that he made him wink
again. The Nonpareil soon returned this
favour with compound interest, and made
the Waterman bite the dust. (Uproarious
applause.) In this round Randall cut the
knuckles of his left hand against the Waterman’s
teeth.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—The head of Parish, from the profuse
colouring it exhibited, showed the handy
works of the limner, but his confidence was
not in the least abated. On setting-to he
was nobbed without ceremony; he also received
in the course of the round a body hit
that sent him staggering away from his
opponent. The returns of Parish were ineffective;
and, in closing, Randall showed
the amateurs the practical advantages of
fibbing; for he here portrayed a feature
peculiar to himself in this respect: when
tired with one hand he changed it, then
worked with the other, till Parish was
thrown undermost. The gluttony of the
Waterman was acknowledged by all present,
and science was allowed him. Betting,
nevertheless, was at a stand-still, so certain
did the event appear to be.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—This was a sharp round; Parish appeared
to more advantage than heretofore.
The left hand of Randall was much lacerated;
nevertheless, in this painful state, it
did not prevent him from doing execution.
In closing, Parish met with a heavy fall,
and was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—The Waterman scarcely ever attempted
to strike first; had he done so, in all probability
a greater chance might have presented
itself. In one or two instances he lost
nothing by commencing the attack. In closing,
a desperate struggle took place to obtain
the throw, after fibbing had been administered;
Randall got Parish down and rolled
over him.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—It was evident Randall was the stronger
man, the better fighter, superior on his
legs, knew how to shape himself for every
situation he had to encounter; in short, he
appeared a complete master of the art of
war. Some hard milling occurred in this
round, and Parish made some good hits;
but he could not turn the scale. Randall
put in a bellier, and got away. The Waterman
followed him in the gamest manner,
and never showed anything like flinching
throughout the fight. Randall put in a
desperate hit in the Waterman’s neck, then
laughed and nodded at him. In closing,
both down. The friends of Randall were
under some alarm, from the quantity of
blood he had lost from his left hand; and
a medical man of some eminence, who was
among the spectators, was rather apprehensive
it might produce fainting.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Randall was not to be got at, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>distinctly took the lead in this round. Parish
gave him a sort of half-arm hit in the
mouth. Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—On setting-to Randall drew on one
side to void the claret from his mouth; but
this was the most effective round in the
fight. It was singular to view Randall hit,
hit, and hit again till the Waterman went
down on his back. (A guinea to a shilling
was laughed at.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—In this round the Waterman appeared
conspicuous. He got Randall into
the corner of the ring, and put in a body
blow that made the Nonpareil wince again;
in fact, he reeled a little, and had it been
heavier it is likely he must have gone down.
But the recovery of Randall was excellent,
he got out of his perilous situation in the
masterly style of a consummate tactician,
and the marks of his left were seen imprinted
on the body of his opponent. After
some little traversing in the ring, Randall
was again in the corner, when it was curious
to observe the mode he took to obtain distance:
he leaned his body back quite through
the ropes, and planted, by this means, a
heavy hit on the Waterman’s mouth, which
soon gave him an opening, when he came
lashing out. Some blows were exchanged,
and Parish with much dexterity hit Randall
under the ear, marking him. The Nonpareil
now gave his man no quarter, and, in
closing, he threw the Waterman so desperately
that his shoulder was nearly dislocated.
This was the most effective round in
the fight, and Parish received considerable
applause.</p>

<p class='c022'>11 and last.—The Waterman was entitled
to every consideration from the manly manner
in which he contested every round.
Although he did not gain much by in-fighting,
he should have tried it at an earlier
part of the fight; he could not have been
worse off. In out-fighting in this round he
was fairly beat to a stand-still; and although
he endeavoured to stop scientifically his
altered face was again punished. In closing,
he received the usual severity; and, on
going down with his brave competitor was
not able to meet him any more at the
scratch. The shouts of victory were loud
and lasting, and the Nonpareil was carried
out of the ring in triumph. The battle
lasted fifty-three minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The capabilities of Randall in
the ring were so evident that comment is
scarcely necessary. What the most skilful
master of the sword exhibits with his weapon,
Randall displayed with the fist. His mode of
fighting did not appear to originate from the
common advantages of teaching: it seemed
completely intuitive, and looked more like a
natural gift than resulting from the minutiæ
of art. Randall gained nothing from chance
blows; and rarely ever made a hit without
its proving effective. If his blows were not
stopped, his distances were so well measured
they were sure of arriving at their destination.
It was asserted he never hit past
the head of his opponent; and though considerable
time was lost in the caution observed
before he struck, it was amply repaid
in his coming off victorious without punishment.
However unpleasing it may be to
state, the positive fact is, Parish had no
opportunity of turning the battle in his
favour: it was all on the side of Randall
from beginning to end; but, notwithstanding
this remark, Parish must be allowed
to have sustained the character of a brave
man, and a good fighter. Although his
face received such tremendous punishment,
his peepers were never closed, and he showed
himself on the same evening at the White
Hart, on the Bromley Road, quite chuffy,
refusing to be put to bed. The absence of
Mr. Jackson was a severe loss to the combatants,
particularly to the losing man, who,
in this instance, had not one single farthing
collected for him.</p>

<p class='c013'>To conquer Randall seemed the enviable object of all the light weights;
a new customer accordingly offered himself, of the name of Burke, from
Woolwich, for 100 guineas a-side. He was a fine, strong young man,
taller than Randall, and possessing great confidence in his own abilities.
Burke was also thought highly of by the officers at Woolwich, from the
capabilities he had displayed in two or three bouts, and he was backed
without any hesitation; indeed, his friends had quite made up their minds
as to his success. Equally confident were the partizans of Randall. As to
himself, he viewed this contest with perfect indifference; in fact, victory
appeared so easy to him, that he scarcely underwent the usual preparation
of training. The day arrived, Tuesday, June 16, 1818, when the battle was
to have been fought at Moulsey Hurst, but the magistrates interfered.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>Combe Wood was the next bit of turf selected for the contest, when a second
interruption occurred from the presence of the beaks. However, this dilemma
was soon got rid of, and the parties made the best of their way towards
Wimbledon Common, followed by the anxious cavalcade. The ring was
made in a twinkling, and Burke followed, by Oliver and Clarke, as his
seconds, entered the ropes and threw up his hat. Randall immediately
after repeated the token of defiance, waited on by Paddington Jones and
Dick Whale. Seven to four on Randall.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Burke appeared an active, fine
young man, and in good condition. He was
anxious to go to work, and soon let fly.
Randall also set-to. In closing the Nonpareil
got his opponent’s canister under
his arm, and served it out as a clown in a
fair operates on a salt box; when tired, he
threw Burke. (Rare chaffing from the Randallites;
two to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Burke was not quite so eager; he
found more caution and a little sparring
necessary. Randall again felt for his nob,
when the claret peeped, and first blood was
declared for the Nonpareil. In closing,
both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—This was a short round, Burke falling
from a slight hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Burke could not protect his nob; in
fact, it was in complete chancery, and he
had no idea of getting it out. His head was
quite altered; in a close, both down. Burke
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—More chancery practice on the part of
Randall, and played off upon his opponent’s
nob, without any return. Randall again got
Burke down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—This was a severe milling round.
Burke showed Randall that he must not be
treated with careless contempt lest he might
prove a dangerous customer. Burke again
went down in a close, undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Randall stopped well, but did not display
himself to so much advantage as in his
previous contests; he appeared more bent
upon running in, and pulling his opponent
down, than decisive hitting. Both down,
but Burke undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—All fighting: and Burke it was thought
had rather the best of it.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Burke, very cautious, tried to make
the most of his science, but went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—This was a sort of scrambling round,
catching hold of each other, and Randall
had not only the worst of it, but in closing,
was down and undermost. The Woolwich
boys were all alive, and gave Burke a lift, by
singing out, “Burke for ever, and you’ll
win it now, if you mind what you’re arter.”</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—This round consisted principally in
sparring and hugging, till Burke was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Confidence, in a boxer, is a most
essential requisite, but he ought always to
be prepared for his enemy. No strange
pugilist ought to be looked upon indifferently,
as he may, in the trial, turn out a
good one. Burke was rather a difficult man
to be got at, from his length and height;
which, it seems, accounts for so much hugging.
Burke was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Similar to the last; disapprobation
expressed by the spectators.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Randall, in closing, got his opponent’s
nob upon the fibbing system, but
Burke gained the throw, and Randall was
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Randall did not make a hit, but
rushed in, and got Burke down undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Of a similar description.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—After a few exchanges of no importance,
Randall put in a tremendous hit on the
neck of Burke, and he went down. (Applause.)</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—In this round, if Burke did not absolutely
frighten the friends of Randall, he
convinced them he was a better man than
they took him to be. The Nonpareil put in
a heavy hit on his opponent’s nob, which
Burke tremendously returned with interest
upon Randall. The former also put in four
heavy hits on Randall’s head without receiving
any return. In closing, a sharp struggle
occurred, till both went down. (This altered
the face of things a little, and the betting
dropped. The Woolwich boys were all
shouting at the success of their hero.)</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Quite unexpected, Burke had also the
best of this round. In a sort of hugging
close, both went down. (Great shouting for
Burke.)</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Randall now went to work sharply,
and gave his opponent a tremendous facer;
but Burke returned the compliment with
interest. Some sharp hits also occurred,
till both went down. (Seven to four, and
two to one on Randall.)</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Burke resorted to science, but his
nob was again in chancery, and the punishment
it exhibited was terrific. In closing,
both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—It was evident now that Burke was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>going: he appeared extremely weak, and
went down from a slight hit. (“It’s all
your own, Jack;” and four to one, but no
takers.)</p>

<p class='c022'>23 and last.—Randall seemed as if he was
determined to wind up the contest with a
grand climax. The already punished head of
Burke again received three additional tremendous
hits upon it which gave it the rolypoly;
and, in closing, Randall threw his
opponent with the utmost ease. When
time was called, Burke could not come, on
account, it was said, of his having dislocated
his shoulder. It was over in three-quarters
of an hour.</p>

<p class='c022'>This contest did not exactly please the
friends of Randall. It was thought he had
been too careless, or that he entertained too
light an opinion of his opponent. He, however
made some skilful stops, which were
much admired; but it was said he won the
fight more from throwing, in the first instance,
than from his usual method of
hitting. It should be taken into consideration,
that Randall had something to do in
getting at his opponent, who possessed the
superiority of length of arm and height of
stature; and, in all probability, he would
have fought for several rounds more if his
collar-bone had not been dislocated. Randall,
as usual, retired from the ring with
scarcely a scratch about his face.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Nonpareil had disposed of all his opponents with so much ease and
certainty, that the sporting world appeared extremely anxious that Turner
should enter the lists with him; an opinion being entertained that the latter
was the only boxer of the light weights that would have any chance of
defeating Randall. The superior tactics and other pugilistic qualities
displayed by Turner in his victories over Scroggins, had rendered him an
object of great attraction among the fancy in general. Randall was also
anxious to fight Turner, by way of a finish to his efforts; in fact, the Nonpareil
delayed commencing publican on that account alone; and two or three
good houses had in consequence slipped through his hands. Randall was
confident as to the result. Victory, and nothing else, appeared certain to
him. This, however, was by no means the general opinion; but when
the following meeting was announced between the above parties, the fancy
were all alive:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“Articles of agreement. October 13, 1818, entered into at Mr. Franklin’s, the Lion and
Goat, Lower Grosvenor Street, Grosvenor Square, between John Randall and Edward
Turner, to fight for the sum of £100 a-side, on Tuesday, the 1st of December. The above
battle to be a fair stand up fight—half minute time, in a twenty-four foot ring. The place
to be named by Mr. Jackson; but the distance from London not to be less than twenty-five,
nor to exceed thirty miles. Randall, on the one side, to choose his own umpire, as to a time
keeper, and Turner also to appoint a time-keeper, on his part; but to prevent any disputes,
Mr. Jackson to appoint a third umpire as a referee, whose decision shall be final. The
whole of the stakes to be made good on Tuesday, the 10th of November, at Mr. Franklin’s,
between the hours of seven and nine in the evening; but if either Randall or Turner wish to
increase the sum to £200 a-side, this latter sum to be made good on Tuesday, the 24th of
November. Mr. Jackson to hold the stakes, or any person whom he may appoint. A
deposit of £20 a-side was placed in the hands of Mr. Franklin; but if the whole of the
stakes of £100 a-side are not made good on the 10th of November, the above deposit to be
forfeited accordingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Randall was generally the favourite; yet Turner was by no means in the
back ground, for the Taffies swore, “Cot splutter her nails, hur’s sure to win
it.” The cool knowing ones, who put national feelings out of the case, and
who only looked to winning the blunt, declared it was a puzzling problem.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>This great match made, Randall went into training on his favourite spot,
Hampstead Heath; where he was rather under the eye and superintendence
of a gallant Colonel, his patron, it being contiguous to that officer’s residence.
He took up his abode at Bob Pilch’s, the Horse and Groom, Hampstead,
which was a centre of attraction for the fancy, it being only a toddling
distance from the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the side of Turner, his friends were equally attentive and alert, and
a “game” dinner was given to the amateurs on Tuesday, November 24, 1818,
at the Chequers Inn, Brentwood, Essex, preparatory to the grand combat.
It was a numerous and most respectable meeting. A livelier dinner was never
witnessed; the cloth was covered from one end to the other with hares,
pheasants, partridges, and venison, served in the highest style of culinary
perfection; the table was also surrounded by live game, of the true British
breed, not to be equalled in any other part of the world: Oliver and Purcell
on one side, Turner and Richmond upon the other. The harmony was of the
richest quality, and “the heroes of the ring” were toasted by the company.
Turner returned thanks for the mention that had been made of his former
exertions, and observed, with much modesty and candour, “that he would
win if he could; but if he lost the match, he trusted that the amateurs
would not have to complain that he had not done everything to give them
satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of the death of Queen Charlotte, this great match was put
off, by the consent of all parties, till Saturday, December 5. This circumstance
tended, if possible, to increase the sporting anxiety upon the event.
The day being altered, it was thought expedient by the backers, to prevent
any misunderstanding, to give publicity to the following:—“It may be
necessary to inform those who are not thoroughly acquainted with the rules
of betting, that, on account of the above day being altered, all bets that have
been laid since the match was made are off, unless agreed by the parties to be
on; but all those bets which were laid before the match was made, stand
good.” It was even betting at Tattersall’s on the Monday previous to the
fight. This circumstance was attributed to the Welsh feeling upon the
subject: five to four was difficult to be got at. The contest being a “war”
question, the Stock Exchange dabbled considerably upon the event. When
the challenge was first given by Randall, and received by Turner, the odds
were seven to four and two to one on Randall; but this seemed rather to
arise from the impetuosity and confidence of his friends, than from a due
estimate of his merits. Consideration soon reduced the odds to five to four,
then twenty-one to twenty, and at length only Randall for choice.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Even betting followed; and at last Turner’s friends, who had been upon
the reserve, began to show out, and actually offered five to four the other
way. This change was attributed to a report that Randall had got a cold in
his neck, and was under the necessity of having leeches applied to reduce
the tumour which arose in consequence. Turner’s father, it appears, had
offered to take the odds against his son to any amount, and actually produced
the blunt for a few hundreds, in order to prove his sincerity. The spirit
of the Ancient Briton was up, and we understand that he was instructed by
his friends in Wales to support the national glory. Tom Belcher had £200
sent up to him from Wales, to bet as he thought proper upon Turner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little hero on his leaving Brentwood, dined at Belcher’s, in Holborn,
on Thursday, and in the course of the evening set off for Croydon, where he
slept that night. He seemed in high condition and good spirits, and expressed
a perfect confidence of success. Randall also shifted his quarters from Hampstead,
and approached the scene of action. He was equally sanguine.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Friday morning the bustle among the fancy was great. Post-chaises,
gigs, carts, buggies, wagons, and every description of vehicle, were called
into requisition; and, in the course of the day the road towards Croydon
presented a motley assemblage of persons of all ranks. Many, too, who could
not muster the means of other conveyance, depended upon their pedestrian
abilities, and set out on foot. Every horse on the road was engaged, and
hundreds were forced to take up their lodgings under circumstances of no
ordinary privation; indeed it was considered but a trifling sacrifice, when
compared with the pleasure to be derived from being present at the fight.</p>

<p class='c007'>On entering the ring, which was pitched on Crawley Downs, Turner
was waited on by Tom Owen and Bill Richmond, Randall by Tom Oliver and
Blake. Odds six to four on Randall. Little time was lost, and at one o’clock
they shook hands, and threw themselves in position for</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—It is impossible to describe the
anxiety impressed upon the countenances of
the spectators on the combatants shaking
hands. The attitudes of both men were
interesting to the admirers of pugilism, and
neither of them seemed wanting in condition.
They eyed each other with the
acute precision of fencing masters, and
seemed positively almost to look into each
other’s hearts. It was dodging, dodging,
and dodging again; and five minutes had
elapsed before a blow had been made, touching
the toes of each other all the time. At
length, after some feints, Turner hit first,
when the prime Irish boy laughed and got
away. The latter, however, was not long in
making a return, and he gave Turner a
jawer and a ribber, but not heavily. More
feints and dodging. Turner hit short with
his right hand, when Randall rushed in and
went to work. He tried to fib his opponent
upon his old favourite system, and a severe
struggle took place for the throw. Both
down, but Turner undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The same caution was manifest on
both sides on commencing this round, and
long sparring again occurred. Randall gave
a bellier, and got away; he was not long in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>repeating it, and adding a facer. Long
sparring. Turner endeavoured to give a
tremendous hit with his left hand, but Jack
was wary, and jumped back two yards.
Very long sparring; in fact, it appeared so
tedious to those who are admirers of downright
milling, that many persons called out,
“When shall we get home?” Turner, with
much dexterity, put in a good hit between
Randall’s guard. (Great applause. “Go it,
Neddy.”) The latter gave two facers, and
plunged his way to work. The finish of this
round was truly severe, fibbing and struggling
till both went down. Twenty minutes
had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The mouth of Turner seemed to show
some tinge of the claret, but there was doubt
about it. He, however, appeared to breathe
very quick, and rather distressed. The tactics
of both the men were of the first order
of science, and it was viewed as astonishing
by most of the old amateurs. Both of
the men were so well prepared, that if the
slightest mistake was made it was not overlooked;
and this may account for the extreme
caution on both sides. Randall had
never anything like such a customer to deal
with before; and Turner had no borer-in to
beat off-hand. This round took thirteen
minutes, and the pauses were so unusually
long that some of the jokers advised Tom
Owen to have a pipe. Cribb wished for his
nightcap, and talked of supper. Old Caleb
advised them to go to work, and hit each
other’s nobs off. After numerous feints,
the round was finished well, Turner undermost,
and Randall fell over him rather
awkwardly upon his neck.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—From the style of fighting displayed
by both of the combatants, it was evident it
must prove a long fight. Both anxious, and
on the look out not to give half a chance
away. Randall put in two body blows.
Turner’s left hand also told on his opponent’s
mouth. The hitting and stopping on
both sides was masterly. Turner’s nose was
now bleeding copiously, and Randall’s face
was pinked. Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—In this round Randall took the lead;
he fibbed his opponent severely, and then
fell upon him heavily in going down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—To attempt to describe minutely the
feints, the pauses, dodgings, etc., would fill a
volume, and therefore we must confine ourselves
to an explicit and short epitome.
Randall spat blood, when Turner’s left hand
caught his opponent’s nose, and the claret
ran down into his mouth. A very long
pause ensued, and it almost seemed that
neither of the combatants wished to make
a hit, so much caution was used. Fifty
minutes had elapsed. Turner made a tremendous
hit with his left hand, but Randall
stopped its effect with fine skill. An exchange
of blows. Turner aimed to do something
with his right and left hands, but the
blows were slight. Randall got away; the
blood from his nose appeared rather troublesome
to him. Trifling exchanges. Turner
seemed tired, and put down his hands, but
they were soon up again on Randall’s offering
to hit. Turner threw two blows away,
when Randall put in a severe body blow.
Another long pause. Randall now put down
his hands, just for a moment’s ease, when
Turner run in, not to lose an opportunity,
but Randall laughed, and was prepared for
him in an instant. Long pause. Several
feints, but no hitting. Randall put in a
heavy blow in the body, but got a sharp
header in return. The Nonpareil seemed to
be changing his mode of attack, and trying
all for the body. Turner was so extremely
awkward and dangerous to be got at, that
Randall displayed more than his usual caution.
Turner stopped a heavy hit, and then
hit Randall on the head; and he also endeavoured
again to use his left hand with
success, but Randall stopped him. Some
fine science was again displayed, and in
struggling for the throw, Randall was undermost.
Turner was now bleeding copiously,
and the claret was also running down from
Randall’s nose.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—This was a tremendous round, and
Turner seemed much distressed in coming
to the scratch. After a few exchanges,
Randall closed, and went sharply to work on
the weaving system, till they both were
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—This was also a fighting round, and
Turner’s left hand got into his opponent’s
face; but Randall, in turn, put in a sharp
bodier. In closing, Turner was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—When time was called, Turner was
about to commence play on Randall’s side of
the ring, when the latter said, “Keep your
own side.” This was a gallant round, and
both fibbed each other in turn. In going
down Randall had the best of the fall.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—This round was full of science; the
hitting and stopping on both sides were of
the finest order of the art. Turner complained
that Randall had trod heavily upon his
toe, and said, “Do you call that fair, Jack?”
Randall, in reply, answered, “I did not.”
In struggling for the throw, Turner threw
Randall over him.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—The best judges were still between
hopes and fears upon the subject. Randall
seemed to have the best of it, but the goodness
of Turner was so well known, that he
did not even now want for plenty of backers.
Randall got Turner into the sun, and put in
a tremendous hit on his left eye, that made
him wink again. He, however, recovered
himself, and gave his opponent a severe one
in the bread-basket. In going down Turner
received a hit which Owen said was foul,
and called out to the umpires respecting
it but no notice was taken by the authorities,
and it went off.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Turner hit his opponent right and
left, but they did not appear heavy enough
to alter the position of Randall, or reduce
his strength. However, it was a desperate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>round. (Seven to four on Randall.) Both
down, and hard milling.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Randall put in a desperate snorter,
that sent Turner’s nob back, and the claret
followed in torrents; he repeated it, and
Turner went down. Randall had now got
upon the head-work, and left pinking at the
body. This was the first knock-down blow,
and great shouting followed it.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—It was really astonishing to witness
the coolness with which Turner came up to
the scratch after the tremendous punishment
he had experienced in the last round.
He also hit out right and left, and some
severe exchanges occurred between them.
In closing, Turner fibbed Randall with some
effect, but the former went down. (Randall
for £100.)</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—A very sharp round. Good fighting
on both sides. In closing, Turner got Randall
down, and also undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—A considerable pause before a blow
was made. Turner at length let fly with his
left hand on the body; but Randall put in
so heavy a blow in Turner’s mouth as nearly
to dislodge his ivory, and the claret flowed
profusely. In closing, Turner fibbed his
opponent, but he fell rather weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—In this round, in struggling for the
throw, Turner threw Randall out of the ring,
and stood up, leaning over the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Turner tried to use his left hand
desperately, but was stopped. Randall
rushed in to finish his man in style, but
he missed his object. At length they both
got into work, till Turner went down exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—In this round Turner put in a sharp
bodier, when Randall’s old forte broke out
with fresh energy. In closing, he peppered
the face of his opponent; it was ditto, ditto,
ditto, ditto, till Turner went down. One
hour and thirty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Turner came to his time undismayed,
and hit left and right, which Randall not
only stopped, but again planted a severe
facer that brought forth the claret in torrents.
In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Turner hit with his left hand on
Randall’s nose, and he also went down from
the force of his own blow. Randall seemed
a little exhausted from the work he had to
perform, and was also bleeding at the mouth.
In fact, this blow seemed to have had more
effect than any he had received during the
fight.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—Randall run Turner down, after an
exchange of a few blows.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Fibbing and Turner a bad fall. The
latter appeared getting weak, but still full of
courage.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Turner came first to the scratch,
with undiminished confidence, and put in a
smart right-handed hit on Randall’s mug.
In the struggle Turner also surprised the
spectators with the strength that he possessed,
throwing Randall with great violence.
Two hours had now elapsed.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Turner astonished the ring by coming
up so cheerful, and some of the good
judges did not know what to think of it;
they said it was not altogether so safe as
many might imagine. Randall planted a
slight hit, and slipped down.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—Turner was first at the scratch, and
hit Randall right and left, but the blows
were not heavy. Randall gave a second
knock-down blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—Randall looked at his fallen foe, and
stooped down, winking to his friends, as it
were, that he thought it all right. This was
a well fought round, and Turner put in some
good hits. In going down, Randall was
undermost. The water of life was here given
to Randall. At this stage of the battle,
upwards of two hours having elapsed, it was
truly extraordinary to witness such exertions
on both sides. Turner hit Randall right
away from him, but the latter followed Turner
up till a terrible struggle took place in
closing. Turner also stopped a severe blow
aimed at him by Randall, and in return he
planted a sharp hit on the Nonpareil’s jaw.</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—Turner again nobbed his opponent
with his left hand, but he was floored from a
tremendous body hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—Notwithstanding the heavy flooring
hit Turner experienced in the last round, he
came up to the scratch as cool as a cucumber.
He commenced fighting, and endeavoured
to do some execution with his left
hand, but Randall stopped him. In a close,
both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—Turner left the knee of his second
first, and quite satisfied the ring that that
fight was not out of him. He made some
good exchanges, till both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—The face of Turner was severely
punished, but his eyes were open, and he
fought as coolly as if he had only commenced
the fight. (“Take him away—he’s too
game,” was the cry.) Turner was again
floored from a severe hit in the body. In
this round a circumstance occurred which
might have proved the overthrow of Randall,
if it had not been prevented. Baxter offered
to bet £5 upon Turner, when Oliver warmly
observed, that he would lay him £10 to £5
three times over, and was leaving his man
to come and stake, but he was called upon
by Randall’s patron not to quit him for an
instant. Jem Belcher lost the fight with
Cribb, it was asserted, in consequence of his
second staking the money, thus giving time
for Cribb to recover his wind.</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—The brave Turner undismayed again
met his man; but went down from a blow.
While on his second’s knee, he was advised
to give in, but his manly heart would not
suffer him to say “No;” his tongue refused
its utterance.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—The state of Turner now appeared so
piteous, and his bravery so much the praise
of the spectators, that several persons cried
out, “Do not let him fight any more.”—“Don’t
say that, gentlemen,” replied Owen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>“he’s worth twenty beaten men!” Turner,
however, went down from a facer.</p>

<p class='c022'>34 and last.—The admiration of all present
was expressed at Turner again coming
to the scratch; and although in a state of
exhaustion, he was cool, collected, and as
game as a pebble. After some other hits, a
blow on the left side of Turner’s head floored
him, that he could not come to time. Two
hours, nineteen minutes, and thirty seconds
had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The first act of Randall, on
being pronounced the victor, was to push the
crowd away from him, and to clasp the hand
of his brave fallen foe with much zeal and
friendship; while Turner, nobly disdaining
animosity, gently patted Randall on the
back, in token that he was the best man,
and had won the battle nobly and in gallant
style. The amateurs applauded both of
them, and pronounced them the two best
bits of stuff, of their weight, in this country.
Turner, it seems, on being repeatedly solicited
to give in, indignantly spurned such
advice, asserting that he could yet win the
battle. His brother, Mr. Baxter, at length
insisted that he should fight no longer, which
put an end to the contest.</p>

<p class='c013'>On victory being declared in favour of Randall, Turner was immediately
carried from the ground by Sutton, in a distressed state, to a neighbouring
farmhouse, put to bed, and every attention and assistance administered
to his wants that humanity could suggest. It is well known that,
heavy as the blows were, added to the extremity of pain he must have felt
from the severity of punishment he had received, these were “trifles light
as air,” compared to the anguish which his mind suffered at the recollection,
afflicting to a brave man, of defeat. He was very ill, but complained most
of the body blows. Randall, in the course of the Saturday evening, arrived
in town, anxious to meet his better half and son; the latter was about two
years old.</p>

<p class='c007'>The public interest was so great upon this occasion that hundreds surrounded
the turnpike gates to learn the name of the winner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall at this time announced his retirement from the ring, and his
intention to serve the public as a publican. We find in Monday morning’s
<cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, after the fight, the following paragraphs headed:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Remnants of the Fight.</span>—Daylight on Sunday morning discovered the
remains of several gigs lying along the wayside, which had been floored by
coming in contact with each other from the narrowness and badness of the
roads. Beds could not be procured at any of the inns; and, in consequence,
hundreds were compelled to travel in the dark. The horses were all dead
beat, the long faces not to be described, and the cleaning out immense. Near
the dwelling of Randall, the Cock, in Tottenham Court road, hundreds were
waiting for the result of the event; and, upon the arrival of Jack, the
applause he received rent the air. The mob round Belcher’s door was
beyond all precedent. In the Borough Market, Cribb’s house was equally
besieged, and those of Harmer, Oliver, and Burn, crowded and surrounded.
The sale of newspapers was as great as if some important victory had been
achieved on the continent, so much anxiety was felt upon this battle. The
first news which arrived in London was that Turner had gained the day.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Numerous bets were made upon the information, and the hoax was not dispelled
till ten o’clock on Saturday night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Turner arrived in town last (Sunday) night; and notwithstanding the
numerous blows he has received upon his face, it was astonishing to see how
quickly the appearance of punishment had left it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At a sporting dinner at Franklin’s,<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c009'><sup>[154]</sup></a> on December 22, 1818, to celebrate
Randall’s victory, a noble lord, a staunch patron of boxing, proposed to back
Martin against the Nonpareil. Martin, who had just defeated “the invincible”
Jack Scroggins (as Pierce Egan calls him after four defeats), in the previous
week (December 18th), was then in the height of his fame; yet a backer
of Randall not only accepted the proposal but offered, lest Martin’s friends
should draw back, to fight £150 to £100; so good a thing did he think it;
though Martin was a stone heavier, touching 11st. 5lbs. In a little row
with the ponderous Burn, Randall displayed his skill upon the “big ’un,”
and offered to fight him for £100, before his match with Martin. These
were of course mere “wild and wandering words, my lord.” For the match
with Martin, £50 on the part of Martin, and £75 for Randall, were posted
on the last day of the year 1818, at Burn’s, and the 4th of May was fixed
for the meeting, that it might not interfere with Newmarket.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall went into training at Hampstead, and in March, in consequence
of some difference of opinion between his trainer and Martin’s, a foot-race
of 100 yards was proposed for £5 a-side. The men agreed to run, and came
together, when Martin beat Randall cleverly by seven yards. The reporter
adds: “This was the first time Randall’s name was coupled with <em>defeat</em>,
but then it was his <em>feet</em> that betrayed him, his <em>fists</em> had no <em>hand</em> in it.” “This
was thought,” as “Elia” says in his “Essays,” “smart writing for newspapers
thirty years ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall generously volunteered to attend and set-to at Martin’s benefit at
the Fives Court, which took place only a week before their fight, and did so.
This is a little trait that speaks volumes for the manly character of the
Nonpareil. We copy the contemporary report, as a specimen of the “road to
the fight” some sixty years ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fancy were upon the alert soon after breakfast, on Monday, May 4,
1819, to ascertain the seat of action, and as soon as the important whisper
had gone forth, that Crawley Downs was the place, ‘the toddlers’ were
off in a twinkling. Gigs were brushed up, the prads harnessed, and the
‘boys’ who intended to enjoy themselves on the road were in motion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Heavy drags and wagons were also to be witnessed creeping along full of
people, with plenty of grub. Between the hours of two and three o’clock in
the afternoon, upwards of 100 gigs were counted passing through Croydon.
The bonifaces chuckled with delight, and screwing was the order of the day.
Long before eight o’clock in the evening, every bed belonging to the inns
and public-houses in Godstone, East Grinstead, Reigate, Bletchingly, etc.,
etc., were doubly and some trebly engaged. The country folks also came in
for a snack of the thing, and the simple Johnny Raws, who felt no hesitation
in sitting up all night if they could turn their beds to account, with much
modesty only asked £1 and 15<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> each for an hour or two’s sleep. The private
houses were thus filled. Five and seven shillings were charged for the stand
of a horse in any wretched hut. But those customers who were ‘fly’ to all
the tricks and fancies of life, and who would not be nailed at any price,
preferred going to roost in a barn; while others, possessing rather more
gaiety, and who set sleep at defiance, blew a cloud over some heavy wet;
devouring the rich points of a flash chaunt, and thought no more of time
hanging heavily than they did of the classics, chaunting and swiping till
many of the young sprigs dropped off their perches; the ould ones who felt
the influence of ‘the Dustman,’ were glad to drop their nobs to obtain
forty winks. Those persons whose blunt enabled them to procure beds,
could not obtain any sleep, for carriages of every description were passing
through the town all night. Things passed in this manner till daylight
began to peep. Then the swells in their barouches and four, the swift
trotting fanciers, hurried from the metropolis; and the road exhibited the
bustle of the great day of Epsom Races. The ‘brilliants’ also left Brighton,
Worthing, etc., about the same period, and thus were the roads thronged in
every direction. The ‘pitiless pelting shower’ commenced furiously at six
o’clock on the Tuesday morning, but it damped nothing but the dust. The
‘fancy’ are too game to prevent anything like weather interrupting their
sports. The ogles of the turnpike men let not half a chance slip through
their fingers, and those persons who, either from carelessness or accident, had
not preserved their tickets, were physicked by paying twice at the same gate.
The weather at length cleared up, and by twelve o’clock the amphitheatre
on Crawley Downs had a noble effect, thousands of persons being assembled.
It is supposed if the carriages had all been placed in one line they would
have reached from London to Crawley. The amateurs were of the highest
distinction, and several noblemen and foreigners of rank were upon the
ground. The short time previous to the combat taking place was occupied
in betting and descanting upon the merits of the pugilists. The high condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>and strength of Martin made a considerable impression upon the
waverers, and some little hedging occurred, though seven to four was the
current price with Randall’s friends.” Martin first appeared in the ring,
and threw up his hat, accompanied by his seconds, Burn and Harmer.
Randall immediately followed, attended by Oliver and Jones. The combatants,
upon meeting, shook hands with each other in the most friendly
manner. The signal was given for stripping, and a most extensive ring was
immediately beat out. At thirteen minutes to one the men set-to:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Upon the combatants meeting
at the scratch, the fine condition of Martin
claimed the peculiar attention of the amateurs.
The human frame could not possibly
have attained a higher degree of perfection.
He wore elastic drawers, and, from his hips
downwards, the symmetry was so complete,
that a sculptor could not have wished for a
finer model. Randall was equally prime;
but from comparison of height and weight
the chance appeared against him, if it had
rested upon these points. Reports had gone
abroad that Martin meant to risk his fortune
in the first two or three rounds; also that
Randall could not bear punishment, and the
baker was determined to smash him on the
outset. The confidence of Martin rather
alarmed a few of the amateurs; but the
steady calculators were not to be moved;
and the recollection that Randall had won
eleven battles in succession—that he had
never been defeated—and had likewise
gained a victory over the skilful Turner,
heightened their opinion, and induced them
to lay it on thicker. The vast multitude
seemed in breathless suspense on the men
making their attitudes. Martin was cautious,
and some time occurred in sparring for an
opportunity to make a hit, when he at length
let fly with his right hand, which reached
his opponent’s body slightly. Randall made
a hit, but the baker’s length of arm stopped
it, when the latter in endeavouring to make
a return, received a one-two on the right
and left side of his face, which instantly
created a pinky appearance. Long sparring
occurred, and both on the look out to obtain
a favourable opportunity. Martin made a
hit, but Randall got away in style, when the
latter was not long in planting a blow on
the body. Counter hits took place, and
Martin, rather encouraged from this circumstance,
pursued Randall to the corner of
the ropes. The Nonpareil, as heretofore,
when placed in this perilous situation, extricated
himself with promptness. He put
in two facers; Martin went staggering away,
and the claret was seen issuing from his
mouth. He now raised himself upon his
toes, when Randall, finding that the length
of the baker’s “peel” was not yet practicable
to get over, planted a severe bodier. Martin
went a little to work, and in closing some
sharp blows passed, and both went down,
Martin uppermost. (Loud shouting, and
“Well done, Martin.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Randall’s left ear was slightly bleeding
from the last encounter. Martin made
a hit on Randall’s shoulder; and he also
stopped the latter in making a return.
Randall, however, was not long in putting
in a bodier, that left the marks of his fingers
as strongly imprinted as if they had been
painted with vermilion. In closing the
Nonpareil fibbed Martin severely, but the
baker obtained the throw and was uppermost.
(Two to one was now current upon
Randall; and several took it, relying upon
the length and strength of the baker.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Martin made a good nobber, and
smiled at the event; but it was only temporary.
Randall put in some bodiers with
great dexterity, these affected the wind of
Martin, and, in closing, Randall not only
fibbed his opponent tremendously, but fell
upon him.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Martin’s face was bleeding and flushed
all over; distress was coming fast upon him.
He, however, made a hit which was stopped,
when Randall, like lightning, put in so
severe a facer that Martin’s head went with
great force against the stakes. He appeared
quite stunned, but did not go down, and
came up tottering to fight with his opponent.
In closing he again received terribly, and
was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The “upper crust” of the baker was
now cracked, and Randall went in sharply
to gain another point, adding more punishment,
but in closing he was undermost.
(Four to one).</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Martin got away from a tremendous
hit; and some long sparring occurred. This
was a severe round; but Martin was punished
down, and Randall fell heavily upon him.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—The Nonpareil had now commenced
his work, and satisfied the amateurs that he
meant to finish it at his leisure; he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>“got him,” as it is termed; but yet this safe
hero to back thinks the battle is not over
till it is positively won, and never gives
the slightest chance away. This was a
short round; when Randall again spoiled
the upper crust, and got his opponent
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The face of Martin was not only red,
but his mouth appeared full of blood. He
made a hit, but Randall got away; he, however,
again pursued him to the ropes, when
Randall hit him on the right eye, and he
went staggering away. Some struggle took
place for the throw, but Randall got Martin
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Martin sparred a short time, seemed
tired, and endeavoured to pull up his drawers,
when Randall was going in to mill, the
baker smiled and soon prepared for action.
In closing Randall threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Martin slipped from a hit, but he
received such nobbers, and appeared so
bothered, that it was observed, the “Master
of the Rolls” had mistaken his place, and
got into the “Court of Chancery.” Randall
fell very heavy upon his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—It was evident that Martin could not
gain a point to change the tide of battle
towards victory. He received a dreadful
blow in the wind; and Randall got away
from nearly all his blows. The fibbing
system was also again renewed with severity,
and Martin was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Randall put in such tremendous
hits, that in struggling Martin fell down
exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—This was a short round, and Martin
was hit as he was going down in the struggle
for the throw. “Foul! foul!” was loudly
vociferated; and it might perhaps have appeared
so to those persons at a distance from
the ring; but the umpires, who were close to
the ropes, and watched every movement,
declared it to be fair.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Another dreadful bodier was put in
by Randall, and Martin went in rather
furious, but he was punished down.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—The talents for serving out and improving
the chance exhibited by Randall in
this round, electrified the spectators, and
astonished the most experienced and accomplished
pugilists on the ground. In the
very short space of time that Martin was
falling to the ground from struggling, Randall
planted three tremendous blows. (“It’s
astonishing,” was the cry; “he is a phenomenon
indeed!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Martin still kept fighting, and this
was a sharp round; but he was hit both on
the head and body staggering away. In
going down the coolness of Randall induced
him to put up his arm to show that he did
not mean to hit his opponent on the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Martin determined to try it on, and
broke away from a close. Some exchanges
took place, but he was hit down severely.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—It was all up. Martin was hit so
severely that he fell upon his face. (A
guinea to a shilling was offered, but no
takers.)</p>

<p class='c022'>19 and last.—It was doubtful whether
Martin could come again. He did, however,
appear at the scratch, in a terrible
state, but it was only to be floored <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans
ceremonie</span></i>. The battle occupied forty-nine
minutes and ten seconds.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Randall never won a battle
with more comparative ease; and, excepting
a slight shade under his left eye, and a
scratch upon his ear, he had no appearance
of having been engaged in a contest. He is a
complete master of the art of war, and his
judgment truly conspicuous. He found the
length of arm possessed by the baker was
not to be got over at first; he then, with
great promptitude, found out the vulnerable
part of the body, till the head of his opponent
became at his service, and then he won
with all the coolness and science of playing
a game of draughts.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the opinion of the best judges, that Randall ultimately must be cried
down, like the famous “Eclipse,” as regarded fighting any man of his own
weight. Martin was a very game man, and a hard hitter; but he had no
chance with Randall, although it is said he weighed above twelve stone, and
Randall only ten stone ten pounds. In point of civility, decorous behaviour,
and quiet conduct in life, Martin yielded to no pugilist on the list; and these
circumstances were not forgotten by the amateurs, who made a collection for
him of £30 on the ground. He was taken to a farmhouse and humanely
attended upon; while Randall put on his clothes, and sat down to view the
fight between Carter (who styled himself the Champion of England), and
Spring, which took place in the same ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall, it appears, received foul play early in the morning of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>above fight; or, in other words, he was “hocussed.”<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c009'><sup>[155]</sup></a> This infamous
scheme, however, had not the desired effect; but the dose operated as a
purgative.</p>

<p class='c007'>A silly Monday disturbance in Battersea Fields, which led to a not very
creditable turn-up between Randall, who had been dining out, and a fighting
tailor named Jem Wood or Hood, in October, 1819, is seized upon by Pierce
Egan for seven octavo pages of slang and ungrammatical “patter;”
“Fistiana,” too, has booked it as a victory, “four rounds for love,” to
Randall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall was now so popular that the manager of the Regency Theatre
engaged him at a salary to exhibit his milling acquirements in a pantomime.
Turner was his friendly opponent upon this occasion, and crowded houses
were the result.</p>

<p class='c007'>In June, 1819, Randall being then about to open in business at the Hole
in the Wall, in Chancery Lane, was challenged by the dread-nought Jack
Scroggins, and a backer of Randall put down a £10 note on his behalf, for a
fight for 100 guineas to come off in August. Randall, not having been consulted,
refused to meet Scroggins, and forfeited the £10.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Tuesday, August 17th, 1819, Randall’s opening dinner was celebrated.
As a specimen we reprint the advertisement from the weekly papers:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>“TO THE PATRONS OF THE NOBLE ART.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“A most interesting match will take place on Tuesday, August 17, 1819, at five o’clock in
the afternoon, in which <span class='sc'>The Nonpareil</span> will exhibit in a new character. The Commander-in-Chief
will preside. It will be a game set-to, and cutting up will prevail, while
the claret will be in full supply. The visitors, if they do not find themselves in Chancery, will
be in the lane that leads to it. The Hole-in-the-Wall will be the rendezvous on this occasion,
where friendship and harmony will do their best to crown Jack Randall’s latest hit.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From this period we do not hear of Jack in the ring, though he constantly
put on the gloves at benefits at the Fives Court, often donning the mufflers
with the scientific Tom Belcher, his brother boniface and neighbour at the
Castle. The following anecdote, headed “Gallantry of the Nonpareil,” is
given on the authority of “Boxiana:”—</p>

<p class='c007'>“On Thursday evening, June 28, 1821, as the Nonpareil was taking one
of his ‘training’ walks, in company with Josh. Hudson and two amateurs,
near White Conduit Fields, a lady and gentlemen were passing, when some
very indecent and unmanly allusions were made to them by four fellows.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>The gentleman endeavoured to turn away from these blackguards, when they
assailed him and the lady more rudely than ever. The Nonpareil immediately
put in a small taste on one of the fellow’s nobs, that floored him. On his
getting up, the Nonpareil took him up to the lady, and insisted upon his
begging her pardon, which the fellow did upon his knees: the other three
refusing to do so, were so severely caned that they could scarcely walk afterwards.
Some brick-makers, who observed the circumstance, immediately
left their work, and came to the assistance of the blackguards, when Randall
floored two of them. Josh. Hudson also made some play with the ‘men
of clay,’ and on some person crying ‘go it, Jack Randall,’ the name was quite
sufficient, and the astonished brick-makers begged his pardon and bolted,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans ceremonie</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>During the two years of Randall’s retirement, Martin had shone as a bright
star in the pugilistic sphere. He had conquered the renowned Josh. Hudson,
the John Bull Fighter; beaten the “hard-hitting” Bristol hero, Cabbage;
disposed of the pretensions of the “slashing” Phil. Sampson, the Birmingham
youth; floored the pretentious Gipsy Cooper at Lewes races; and finally
disposed of Josh. Hudson’s brother David at Moulsey. This led to a second
match with Ned Turner, by whom in his early career Martin had been
defeated. In this affair Randall backed Turner, and with Tom Belcher
seconded him in the battle. Turner’s defeat at the hands of Martin so vexed
Randall that in a moment of irritation he declared his readiness to fight
Martin for £300. This was foolish and in bad taste, as Randall had formally
taken leave of the ring two years previously, with a public challenge to all
England at eleven stone, for 500 guineas. This sudden challenge was not
immediately accepted, as the backers of Martin hesitated at the largeness
of the sum; but the friends of Martin, upon weighing the facts of Randall’s
recent illness, his life as a publican, and the supposed inroads of “blue ruin”
upon his constitution, screwed up their courage and signed articles for the
£300. It is stated in contemporary papers that upwards of £200,000 were
dependent upon the issue of this fight, and that one gentleman had a book
of £5,000, at six and seven to four on Randall.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Tuesday morning, September 16, 1821, long before daylight, and all
the preceding night, the roads leading to Crawley Downs, Sussex, were
covered with vehicles of every description, so great was the interest excited
throughout the sporting world to witness the Nonpareil once more display
his skill in the art of self-defence. The ring was made in a field, within a
mile of East Grinstead, in which Martin threw up his hat; but, owing to
some misunderstanding between the persons conducting this business in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>absence of the Commander-in-chief, the fight was removed to Crawley Downs,
but not till hundreds had paid a heavy toll for passing through a gate,
which sums of money of course were not refunded on changing the scene of
action. For a long time it was thought no fight would take place. By this
time the multitude had so increased that it was deemed necessary to enlarge
the ring; and about three o’clock, Randall, in a white “upper Benjamin,”
arm-in-arm with his backers, appeared, and, with much coolness threw his
hat into the ropes. Shortly afterwards, Martin, accompanied by his backers,
displaying their white toppers, also approached the ring, and answered the
token of defiance by sending his castor into the ring. Martin was loudly
applauded by the spectators. Tom Spring and an amateur were seconds for
“the Master of the Rolls;” Paddington Jones and “Cicero” Holt officiated
for Randall. The combatants on meeting each other shook hands in the most
friendly manner. Current betting six to four on Randall.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On stripping, the frame of
Randall was a perfect picture for the anatomist,
and every person was astonished at the
very fine condition he exhibited. The confidence
he displayed was remarkable. His
face had no trait of ferocity about it, but, on
the contrary, cheerfulness and true courage.
Martin was lighter in person than heretofore,
but his condition was said to be, by his
backers, equal to the finest racehorse. His
legs, which were covered with striped silk
stockings, were round and elegant, and the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> was that of a boxer capable of
performing great execution. He smiled and
appeared confident. On placing themselves
in attitude, Randall was the object of attraction
all over the ring; he stood as firm as
a rock. The position of Martin was good,
but he did not appear to stand so steady as
his opponent. A minute elapsed in looking
at each other, but the eyes of Randall
seemed almost to penetrate his opponent.
Both anxious for an opportunity to make a
hit. Martin smiled. Randall made a sort
of feint with his left hand, which was well
stopped by Martin. Manœuvring and dodging
each other for a few steps, which was
succeeded by a pause. Randall endeavoured
to put in a tremendous right-handed blow,
but missed his object. Martin now ventured
to take the lead, and exerted himself
to make his right and left hand tell, but
Randall with the utmost dexterity stopped
them both. Martin felt tired and dropped
his arms; but, on perceiving Randall ready
to take advantage of this opening, he hastily
resumed a defensive attitude, when the
Nonpareil immediately went to work, and
planted a severe right-handed hit just above
the wind, which made the Master of the
Rolls bite his lips. Another pause succeeded;
but the attitudes of the men were uncommonly
fine. The action of the muscles was
beautiful; and the arms of Martin, and the
shoulders of Randall, were studies for the
artist. The combatants closed on Randall’s
decoying Martin to follow him to his favourite
corner of the ring, and in this situation,
often as the Nonpareil had astonished the
amateurs with his forte for fibbing, he now
put forth such a “bit of good truth” as positively
to terrify the spectators with the terrible
execution he was capable of administering.
He fibbed Martin with his left hand
in the most rapid manner, and then changed
him on his arm like a baby, and repeated
four or five blows on his face and neck,
operating so decisively on the jugular vein
that the eyes of Martin turned up, and he
foamed at the mouth. A few drops of claret
followed, which appeared to have been drawn
from his ear, and Randall did not leave him
till he was within four inches of the ground.
Martin was now so stupid that the back part
of his head fell against the stake; but the
mischief had been done before this period.
“It’s all up,” was the cry; and to describe
the consternation of the ring, or to depict
the countenances of the spectators, would
defy the talents of a Lavater. Martin was
picked up in a state of stupor, and remained
insensible for a long period after time was
called. He was carried out of the ring;
but in the course of half an hour, when in
bed, and attended by the P. C. doctor, Mr.
Hughes, a gentleman possessing superior
talents as a medical man, he recognized
Spring, and, on opening his eyes, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>utmost astonishment inquired where he was,
and if he had lost it? Randall had only a
slight mark on the tip of his nose and under
his right eye.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This fight is without a
parallel, it having been won in one round,
occupying nearly eight minutes. Although
so short, yet the excellence of Randall was
so great that no one could have complained
to go fifty miles at any time to witness such
a display of the art. So finished a boxer as
Randall was never seen in the prize ring.
The attitude of Martin attracted great attention
and praise; and the extreme caution
evinced on both sides established the advantages
of coolness and a knowledge of tactics.
Till the closing occurred, the general
opinion seemed to be that Martin had none
the worst of it at out-fighting; but when the
Nonpareil got in (and right truly is Randall
named a Nonpareil, for where is his fellow
to be found among the milling coves of his
weight?) he held Martin as tight in his
grasp as if he had been screwed in a vice.
After the fight it was ascertained that Martin
did not weigh more than two pounds
heavier than Randall. The character of the
Master of the Rolls had hitherto stood very
high in the opinion of the sporting world
for his scrupulous attention to training, and
it is true he was never attached to wetting
his neck; but, poor fellow, like our common
ancestor, Adam, it is certain he was not proof
against another temptation.</p>

<p class='c013'>As to Martin he attributed the loss of the fight to an accident, and issued
a challenge for a third contest. Randall replied that he had declared beforehand
that, win or lose, this should be his last battle, and moreover that his
challenge was the result of a promise to Turner, that if Martin beat that
boxer he would fight him himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall make no apology for transferring a letter from an eyewitness,
who came up from Cambridge, to a university friend, as the best report of
this eventful fight and its accompanying incidents.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Agreeably to promise, I sit down to write you some account of the great pugilistic
events of yesterday, such as they appeared to my inexperienced eyes, and such probably as
they would have done to yours. The intense interest excited in our minds by the sporting
intelligence conveyed by the London press, and the difficulty of discriminating the plain,
simple, unvarnished fact, amidst the eloquence and metaphorical colouring in which battles
are narrated, renders it necessary that we ourselves should, once at least, see a prize-fight,
in order perfectly to understand the events of the day, and be able to converse rationally on
matters which are the subject of discussion in every body’s mouth. I was accordingly determined
to see this fight, but it was a matter of tenfold more difficulty than I had anticipated.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I had expected that our sporting friend’s letter of introduction to —— would have made
everything easy, as that gentleman is supposed to be in the secret of all the sporting world.
Nothing farther, however, could be learned, except that it was supposed that it would be on
Crawley Downs, and a reason was given for this selection, that it would be an accommodation
to the Brighton amateurs, who would in that case contribute £40 or £50 towards the
reward of the performers. Nothing, however, was decided, and the amateurs, who were
determined at all events to see the sports of the day, were written to by their friends to come
up to London to head quarters, as the only means of making sure of not being disappointed.
In fact, numerous amateurs arrived from Norwich, Canterbury, Cheltenham, Bristol, and
other country towns, and at a tavern kept by Mr. Thomas Belcher, of fighting notoriety,
friends from all these different places, attracted by kindred feelings, renewed their
acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c018'>“By-the-bye, you would be surprised how successful the fighting men are when they set
up a place of public resort. In the country places, ale and strong liquors are best sold under
the patronage of the Duke of Wellington; and his head being hung up over the door is a
strong inducement for a genuine Englishman to enter, quench his thirst, and promote the
revenue of his country. In Paris, at their coffee-houses, we observed they always had an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>elegant, young, and handsome female seated in a conspicuous place, as an object of attraction
to the house; but the best painted head of the Duke of Wellington in the country, or
the finest woman in Paris, never drew so respectable an assemblage as is brought together
by the intense admiration felt for the heroism and manhood of Tom Cribb, Jack Randall, or
Tom Belcher. The other sporting publicans all do well, and have their coteries of friends
who patronise them, and find the liquors nowhere so genuine and constitutional as in the
houses of these hardy supporters of English glory. It would have astonished you had you
seen what an assemblage was at Belcher’s for some nights before the battle. You might
have stood an hour before you could have got a seat, and barmaids and waiters were as much
fatigued in serving out the liquors as the combatants after serving out to each other in the
prize ring. The money was all alive. Five, ten, twenty, and fifty pound notes were common
as waste paper, and were staked as freely on the event. It is wonderful how much the
revenue must have benefited by the stimulus given to business before and after a great
battle. One thing, however, I detest, and that is, that British amateurs should drink
brandy, as many of them do. It is a suspicious liquor, and tastes of contraband. Let
us stick to true brown, or real British dew; they accord best with the constitution. At
Belcher’s there is a ‘Daffy Club,’ which makes this observance their leading rule. But
to return to the history of the fights.</p>

<p class='c018'>“A Council of War, as I was told, was held, at which were present a gallant general and
three other amateurs, who had backed the men, and the historian of the prize ring; and, on
comparing intelligence, and considering the letters from the various parts of the country,
Crawley Downs was decided to be the place least likely to be subject to interruption. This
was known at the sporting houses on Monday evening; and as it was upwards of thirty miles
from town, and only known that night, it was put out of the power of the walking amateurs
to attend. Here I cannot help regretting that the interruption given to sports occasionally
by parsons and other ill-advised magistrates, should render it a matter of prudence to adopt
such a course to prevent a numerous assemblage on such national occasions. It is depriving
an immense mass of the lower orders of the benefits of the lessons of valour, forbearance,
perseverance, and manly spirit, to be learned around the prize ring, and nowhere else. It
is, I conceive, a most aristocratic proceeding, trenching on the liberties and pleasures of
the people, and ought not to be continued. If we did not know our ‘patriots,’ as they call
themselves, to be often mere humbugs, and to love nothing but what brings forward themselves
in conspicuous characters, they would come forth and assert in Parliament and public
meetings the people’s rights on such occasions. But, like the methodist and methodistical
parsons, they hate all sport that withdraws attention from themselves. However, I do allow
the assemblage was, in consequence of the absence of the pedestrian fancy, very select.
Nine out of ten of the men on the ground had the dress and appearance of gentlemen, and
the vehicles and cattle were certainly a show worth coming all the way from London to see.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It was long before the business of the day commenced, and the amateurs walked about
and friends from all parts of England met and exchanged salutations, and communicated
intelligence of the state of science in their respective neighbourhoods.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The carriages, waggons, and stands erected for viewing the fight, were arranged in some
places three or four behind each other, in an oval of 200 feet by 250 feet, and were covered
with spectators. The ring was at first of smaller dimensions, but it was necessary to enlarge
it. There was immense trouble to the pugilistic characters on the ground with their whips
in forcing back the multitude, who were within the enclosure, to the carriages. At last the
men stripped and set-to. They stood before one another, with their eyes directed forward,
watching every move. They changed their ground, but still their arms kept in parallel,
marching and countermarching to prevent surprise. It reminded military amateurs of the
parallel movements of Wellington and Marmont before the glorious ‘mill’ at Salamanca. At
last they exchanged hits. Randall put in a blow on the breast, which made it appear red; he
had a blow under the eye and on the nose, but made a most dreadful return, and came in on
his man, caught him in one arm, and his other went to work so fast, it seemed like the
motion of a mill wheel in full speed. Both fell, and were picked up; but Martin’s head
hung down like an apple on its stalk. The seconds put it in its proper place, but it dropped
again. They moved it backwards and forwards, like a baker rolling about a loaf in flour;
they threw water on him, waved their hats to cool him, but all was not enough; and when
thirty seconds had elapsed, time was called, but his senses were gone. Thus was the battle
lost. The amateurs were sadly disappointed as to their hopes of a long and beautiful fight:
and from the attitudes of the men, and their known science and game qualities, it was fairly
to be expected. It was reported Martin was killed; but the feelings of the spectators were
relieved by word that, on being bled he became sensible, and in a fair way of soon doing
well.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The conqueror walked about on the ground, and enjoyed the admiration in which he was
held by the spectators, and a flight of pigeons was let off to convey the intelligence to town.</p>

<p class='c018'>“After the first fight, the multitude inundated the ground, and there was no order
observed afterwards. The commander-in-chief was absent, and republican government will
never do. It was attempted to clear the ground, but the multitude was not forced half so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>far back as the carriages. If the circle had been larger, they might all have seen; but one
half of them saw nothing, and attempted to push forward, and they partly hid the view from
the spectators on the carriages. Individuals exerted themselves to keep a wider ring, laid
on the whip, but there was no system of acting in concert, and if such were usually the case,
few people would be induced to go to see a fight. The men hit away well; some beautiful
stops of blows were made, but many told home. Their bodies, which were white at the commencement,
exhibited patches of scarlet at a distance. They often closed and hugged, and
their arms were in motion like two mill wheels. They threw each other down, and frequently
over the ropes. The seconds applied the water, and rubbed them like the grooms do
horses in the stable, put their men in condition, and made them respectable in their appearance.
The contest was well supported to the last, and both men were very much punished.</p>

<p class='c018'>“On a moderate calculation, I presume £10,000 or £12,000 would not cover the travelling
expenses of the amateurs assembled. What a pity we do not enjoy the glorious liberty of the
days of King George II. We might have had all the sport in a theatre in Oxford Street, or
in Tottenham Court Road; and a fraction of the money now spent in travelling would
reward the men for their exertions. Much valuable time might also be saved for business.
But it is a matter of infinite regret, that the pretended friends of liberty abandon the
interests of the people, and never defend public meetings, except those at which they themselves
may exhibit. But let us hope for better times, and there are some promising
symptoms, and we may have sports at once commodious, agreeable, and at a moderate
expense. I shall tell you more when I return, and meanwhile,</p>

<p class='c007'>To this brilliant squib poor Pierce innocently puts it upon record that he
“wrote a poetical reply,” which he forwarded to the editor of the <em>Morning
Chronicle</em>, “who did not publish it.” We should have wondered if John
Perry had done so. Accordingly Pierce resolved to “print it, and shame the
fools.” Those who delight in doggrel will find this “rejected address” at
pp. 112 and 113 of the fourth volume of “Boxiana.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A third match was, however, hastily made on March 11, 1822, after a
dispute; it ended in a wrangle, and a forfeit of Randall’s backers’ money,
owing to failure in a deposit, fixed to be made good at Spring’s; Martin
received the £200 down.</p>

<p class='c007'>“More last words” appear from time to time in the papers, in the shape
of challenges, acceptances, replies, and rejoinders, signed by Randall, Martin,
and a host of pseudonymous friends, backers, “Impartial Observers,” “Justitias,”
and the like, till the public became sick of this vamped up “literature
of the ring,” as the historian innocently calls it. Pages of this rubbish
are stuffed into the volumes of “Boxiana.” The “third great match between
Randall and Martin,” was made for 1,000 guineas, and “the money all made
good over a sporting dinner at Randall’s, November 5, 1822.” On the 15th
of the same month, however (we condense from “Boxiana”), at Jackson’s
rooms, Bond Street, it was announced that Mr. J. had received a letter from
Mr. Elliot, the backer of Martin, requesting that he would send him a cheque
for the £500, stating that his man should not fight against nothing, as
Martin would be sued for the £200 forfeit he had received from the backers
of Randall. Randall expressed himself warmly on the subject, declaring he
had been ill-treated. He had lost his time, left his business to go into training,
and spent a considerable sum of money. A benefit was accordingly
organised for Randall, which took place at the Fives Court, on the 4th of
December, 1822, and was overflowingly attended.</p>

<p class='c007'>In January, 1823, Randall and Josh Hudson wishing to give Jack’s old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Hampstead trainer, the well-known Bob Pilch, a turn, were enjoying themselves
at the Horse and Groom. It is and always has been a penalty of
celebrity in any line of life to be intruded upon by the impertinent, the
curious, and the conceited. Jack Randall and his friend Josh. were soon
objects of vulgar attention, when they went out to take the air in the
village. An elderly man among their followers, who ought to have known
better, and who had been indulging too freely, several times touched Randall
in the back with an umbrella as he was ascending the steep hill, when the
Nonpareil forbearingly asked him to desist; no further notice would have
been taken of the rudeness had it not been for a brewer’s servant and his
companions. This fellow, known as “The Cock of Hampstead,” six feet in
height, and about thirteen stone, had, it seems, a hankering for a “shy at
Randall,” and thought this a fine opportunity for the experiment. We quote
from “Boxiana.” “He put out his tongue by way of derision, saying, ‘Who
cares for Randall or Josh. Hudson, I wonder? They would be afraid to talk
to a younger man so!’ and, without further notice, gave Randall a flip on
his nose, by way of notice of his intentions. Jack returned the compliment
with interest, not wishing to remain long in debt to the man of grains.
During the first and second rounds nothing but sharp work was displayed,
the fighting being all on the side of Randall, and the strength on that of the
Cock. In the third round Jack received so severe a blow on the tip of his
shoulder, added to the tightness of his coat, that he could not lift up his arm,
and immediately tore off his Benjamin. The little trump, being disencumbered
from his togs, then went to work with the big one in terrific style (something
like the slaughtering mill in which he so dreadfully served out Baruk,
the Jew); and in two more rounds the man of grains was so punished about
his nob, that it was pitiable to behold. Randall, in going down with the
Cock, never left him, but tremendously fibbed his opponent. On Josh picking
up Randall, he felt a little surprised on viewing the face of the latter,
which, to all appearance, looked as bad as his adversary’s; but, on wiping
of it, Hudson laughingly exclaimed, ‘Oh, I perceive you have only fell
into the paint-pot, you are not hurt; but you should not have robbed your
opponent of any of his colour. A novice serve you so, very likely indeed!’
The sixth round put an end to the crowing of the Cock; he was quite done
up, and was so altered in complexion, as scarcely to be recognized by his
friends. His pal, another big one, also fell foul of Jack, when Josh was
about to tackle him. ‘Never mind,’ said Randall, ‘I have got a little one
for him presently.’ One round completely satisfied the second hero of the
grain fraternity, who received in that small space of time pepper enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>last him for a twelvemonth. Randall and Josh now reached the Horse and
Groom without any further molestation; but as they were blowing a cloud,
and laughing over the various scenes which had crossed their career, a third
hero of the grain department put in his appearance, with £100 to fight
Randall. On Hudson chaffing this chap, that ‘he believed Jack could wap
the brewery all round,’ he took fire, and thought he could punish Josh.
‘Well,’ replied Hudson, ‘perhaps you may; but if you will take a little bit
of amusement with me on the heath, as I would not on any account create
a riot in honest Bob’s house, you will then know a little more about
the matter.’ The grain cove entertained an opinion, ‘the weather was rather
too cold for the sport,’ fobbed up his blunt, and on his ‘better half’ looking
into the room after him, he retired in a whole skin. The Nonpareil and
John Bull fighter then spent the evening pleasantly, returned to London
comfortably, and reached their places of roost in perfect safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The name of Randall was now known in the religious world, for it is
said one of the lower order of ranting preachers, not a hundred miles from
Bolton-in-the-Moors, addressed his auditors in the following metaphorical
language:—‘I dare say you’d all pay to see a boxing-match between Turner
and Randall, and yet you don’t like to pay to see a pitched battle between
me and Beelzebub. Oh, my friends, many a hard knock, and many a cross-buttock
have I given the black bruiser for your sakes! Pull, do pull off
these gay garments of Mammon; strike the devil a straight blow, and darken
his spiritual day-lights! At him manfully, and I’ll be your bottle-holder.
I ask nothing but the money, which I hope you’ll not forget before you
go.’” “Boxiana,” vol. iv., pp. 120‒122.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Dick Curtis’s benefit (March 27, 1823), Randall asked Gipsy Cooper
if he had challenged him for £200 a-side as was reported. Cooper replied,
“No, I did not, you are too good a fighter for me, Jack.” At Spring’s
benefit, however (May 5th, 1823), the Gipsy challenged Randall for £200
a-side, authorised by Mr. Elliott, his backer, so to do. Randall replied he
would fight for £300 a-side; he was settled in business, and had a wife and
three children to provide for, less would not suit him; indeed he did not
mean to fight any more prize battles. Randall’s challenger did not persevere,
and from this time Randall attended to his business at the Hole-in-the-Wall,
which is frequently named in the progress of pugilistic matches and deposits
for sporting events. One little episode of Jack’s publican’s life, as we find it
reported in the papers for January, 1826, we will find room for, as it gives
us a glimpse of the character for forbearance which has always marked, in
our experience, the true-bred and courageous pugilist.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>“<span class='sc'>Hatton Garden, January 24th.</span>—A fashionably dressed man about
the middle age was brought up from the Eagle Street Watchhouse, where he
had passed the previous night, on the introduction of Mr. John Randall,
mine host of the Hole-in-the-Wall, Chancery Lane, the unvanquished hero
of the P. R. Jack’s science, every one knows, does not consist in sophistry,
though his arguments have often been considered forcible, nay, irresistible.
In his own straightforward way, he told Sergeant Sellon a round unvarnished
tale, about ‘this ere bit of business,’ as he called it. On Monday night,
about a quarter after eleven, the Hole-in-the-Wall was closed up, and Jack
was settling the accounts of the day in the bar, as was his wonted custom,
when a loud knocking announced the arrival of late visitors. ‘You can’t
come in,’ cried Jack, ‘I wish to keep my house regular, and no man comes in
here to-night, for it’s after hours, d’ye see.’ This, however, did not satisfy
the thirsty party without, and a voice demanded instant admittance, in a
rather peremptory tone. ‘You don’t know who I am, Randall,’ quoth the
speaker. ‘No, nor I does’nt care,’ responded the Nonpareil. ‘Why, I am
Cooper, the mayor of Canterbury; don’t you remember meeting me at the
races at Doncaster?’ Randall’s reminiscences are often pleasing, but, at all
events, without designing to admit his old acquaintance, he resolved to have
the ‘ocular proof;’ he straightway opened the door, when in bolted the
pretended mayor and his satellites. ‘Do you know me now?’ ‘No, I
don’t,’ said Jack, ‘not a bit of it, neither now nor then; so you’ll please to
bundle off, Mr. Mayor.’ This was not intended, and the latter replied, that
as he was a ‘flash man,’ he had an undoubted right to accommodation in a
‘flash house,’ and stay there he would; and if Jack pleased, he would have
a ‘turn-up’ for it. Jack very good-humouredly hinted, that he would rather
see a ‘turn-out;’ whereupon the Canterbury Mayor struck him in the face.
The hero of the fistic art, though accustomed to return compliments of this
sort with cent. per cent. acknowledgments, very prudently held back, and
calling in the watch to his aid, the mayor was put <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</span></i>, and found
himself eventually in the watch-house. The defendant pleaded hard that he
never did assume the character which Mr. Randall described. His name was
simply John Samuel Powell, that he was a plain country gentleman, and
never had the honour of filling the civic chair of Canterbury, though he
certainly had met Mr. Randall in company with Mr. Cooper, who held that
distinguished station, at the aforesaid races. With respect to the assault complained
of, he would not deny the charge, though he had no recollection
of it, his senses being steeped in forgetfulness. Having the highest respect
for the talents of Mr. Randall, he was anxious to make the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amende honorable</span></i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>if it would be accepted. ‘There now,’ exclaimed Jack, extending his hand,
‘that’s enough, man; but if I had treated you as you treated me, you
wouldn’t be standing afore his worship just now.’ The complaint was then
dismissed at Randall’s request.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall’s constitution—he was a persistent drinker of ardent spirits—gave
way under the irregularities of a licensed victualler’s life; Jack never possessed
the moral courage to say “No” to a drop with every customer who
proposed to “wet an eye,” and but rarely with those who suggested to “wet
the other.” He was a martyr to gout, complicated with a disorganisation of
the liver and a fatty degeneration of the heart. These disorders prostrated
him, and finally carried him off at the early age of 34 years. He died March
12th, 1828, at the Hole-in-the Wall, Chancery Lane.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall’s pugilistic and personal merits are thus summed up by a contemporary:—In
a twenty-four feet ring a better general or a more consummate
tactician was never seen: judgment and decision were manifest in all his
movements. His heart is in the right place; his head cool and collected, to
take advantage in the most prompt style of the disorder of the opponent
before him; his mind looking confidently forward to nothing but victory.
In short, as a pugilist, he is the Nonpareil. Randall’s style seems the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne plus ultra</span></i> of the art of self-defence. Out of the ropes, however, he is one
of the most simple of human beings. Yet Lavater, with all his knowledge
of physiognomy, might have looked at his mug, and looked at it again and
again, and not have discovered his real character from the lineaments of his
face. If Randall cannot express himself in the sentimental manner of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>Sterne, gammon the tender path of society with the Platonic taste of a
Rousseau, or wind up a tale with the speciousness of a Joseph Surfage,
he can be backed against them all for the possession of genuine feeling.
A common observer might say he was a rough, illiterate fellow, for he
does not attempt to conceal his deficiencies. He has no affectation about his
composition—deception does not belong to him, and bluntness is his forte.
He is indignant at what he thinks wrong; and is not over nice in his
expressions, whenever such a subject is the theme of argument. He admires
truth; and his honesty, if not Brutus-like, is as staunch and incorruptible.
A liar will be sure to hear of his faults from him. Though education has
done little for him, experience has given him “the time of day.” But, kind
reader, if thou hadst seen him relieve an ould Irish woman, at “peep of
day,” with the only half-crown he was master of, as she was going to market
with an empty pocket and basket, anxious to support two of her orphan
grandchildren to prevent their going to the parish, when she had solicited
him for only two-pence to aid her charitable design;—if you had seen the
effect of her plaintive tale, and the blessings she invoked upon his head for
this real act of benevolence; his turning aside to weep; and the jeers he
experienced from his companions upon the weakness he had displayed;—if
you had also witnessed him pushing the crowd aside the instant he was proclaimed
the conqueror over Turner, to grapple with the hand of his great
rival in friendship, and seen the big tear stealing down his cheek, in admiration
of the bravery of his opponent;—if you had known, as the writer did,
of his refusal to prosecute a man and his wife, whom he had trusted in the
bosom of his family, and who, under the mask of friendship, had robbed him
at various periods of £300—I don’t know what you might have said of him,
but Burns would have told us, despite his defects, “a man’s a man for
a’ that.” And such a man was Jack Randall.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>NED TURNER—1814‒1824.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Ned Turner, who was born in Crucifix Lane, in the borough of Southwark,
November 8th, 1791, was of Welsh extraction, his parents being
natives of the Principality, and his kith and kin very respectable people at
New Town, Montgomeryshire. Hence the “ancient Britons” of the
metropolis proudly claimed Turner as their countryman, and, as we shall
see, he was heartily backed and supported by the brave sons of the Cymry
in his pugilistic ventures. Turner’s calling was that of a skin-dresser, and
he was duly apprenticed to that ancient craft and mystery, at a yard in
Bermondsey, where a very large number of men were employed. Here there
was a sparring club, or school for glove practice, in which young Turner
greatly distinguished himself, by the quickness, natural grace, and intuitive
steadiness of his style of sparring.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Envy doth merit as its shade pursue,</div>
      <div class='line'>And by her presence proves the substance true,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>and this was exemplified in the circumstances of Turner’s first battle.
The foreman of the yard, one John Balch, a Bristol man, not only fancied
himself, by birth-place and judgment, an oracle in matters pugilistic, but the
champion of the yard. It appears he often spoke disparagingly of the Welsh,
as “border” men are apt to do: indeed he forgot himself so far as to sneer
at young Turner’s sparring pretensions, and intimated his ability to “snuff”
the young Welshman out. Turner modestly doubted the boaster’s ability,
and a meeting “for love” ended in nearly an hour’s hard fight on the side of
John Balch, when Turner, though the younger (he was only in his twentieth
year), lighter, and shorter man, had beaten Balch so completely blind that he
was led helpless from the ring. Turner, it may well be supposed, was soon
famous in the dominions of “Simon the Tanner,” yet we may here note, on
the authority of a contemporary, “that never, from his earliest days to the
present period of his pugilistic celebrity, did a challenge first proceed from
Ned Turner to any man.”<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c009'><sup>[157]</sup></a> By him the ancient sage’s precept, albeit
unknown in its didactic form, was felt and adopted as a rule of life:—</p>

      <div class='line'>Often too far.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For the minor battles of Turner, which form the prefatory matter to his
ring doings, we are entirely indebted to Pierce Egan, as the journals of the
period contain no trace of these by-affairs of a boxer as yet without public
fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A publican, of the name of Keating, landlord of the Black Horse, in the
vicinity of St. Giles’s, brought forward a big Irishman, whom he had
patronised, to fight Turner in the cockpit at the Huntsman and Hounds, in
Lock’s Fields, for five guineas a side (1813). For the first three rounds
Paddy bored in upon Ned with the utmost fury, and the latter in going down
fell with his back upon the short stakes which formed the pit. The contusion
was so severe and painful that Turner did not recover from its effects
for the course of several rounds. At length Ned got into work, and before
twenty-five minutes had elapsed, Paddy was so bothered, beaten, and blind,
that he could not tell whether he was living at that moment either in
England or Ireland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Turner, soon after the above circumstance (1814), in company with
three of his fellow-workmen, left London to fulfil an engagement he had
made at a skin-yard in Glasgow. A man of the name of M’Neil, a spirit
dealer, and a pupil of Carter’s, had threatened, previous to the arrival of
Turner, to mill all the Englishmen in Glasgow. In fact, M’Neil was the
champion of that place, and was in height five feet eleven inches, and weighing
thirteen stone. Turner was soon singled out after his arrival in Glasgow
by M’Neil for a trial of skill. A match was accordingly made for five guineas
a side, and the contest was decided in a room. In the course of half an hour
M’Neil was completely defeated. Some time afterwards he wished to have
another trial allowed, and £5 a side was deposited to make it for a larger
sum; but M’Neil preferred forfeiting the deposit to entering the ring again
with Turner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ned, upon quitting Glasgow, went to Newcastle (1816). At this place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>Turner was challenged by one Blacket, a slater, well known for the pugilistic
feats he had performed in this part of the country. A finer proportioned
young man was not to be seen than Blacket. He was symmetry itself,
of prodigious strength, and not deficient in bottom. He was in height six
feet and one inch, weighing rather more than fourteen stone. The battle was
fought on the race-course, in the presence of thousands of spectators. In the
course of forty-five minutes Blacket received so much severe punishment,
without being able to return any milling upon Turner, that he swore in the
utmost rage, ‘he would not fight any more, as Turner was not a fair fighter,
and that he did nothing but make hits, and then jump away!’ Turner was
much applauded for the skill he displayed in conquering a man so much
above his weight, and a liberal subscription entered into by the amateurs as
a reward for his bravery.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Soon after Turner had returned to the metropolis, in a turn up with
Youler (Davenport’s Jew), a ruffianing sort of fighter, in St. George’s Fields,
in the course of thirty-five minutes he so completely satisfied this boring
Israelite, that he retired from the conflict with terrible body punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At the Cottage of Content, in Lock’s Fields, Turner was one evening
set upon by five watermen, who, it seems, had made up their minds to
give our hero a milling. The manly conduct of the sculler gentry, however,
was soon placed to its proper account. Turner disposed of the first four with
as much nonchalance as if they had been sacks, and the fifth, who, it appears,
had some pretensions to boxing, and who endeavoured to make something
like a regular stand against Ned, paid dearly for his temerity, by leaving off
under numerous marks of severe punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These conquests, although they display every trait of courage and
science, yet, in the opinion of the amateurs, amount to little until a boxer
makes his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">debût</span></i> in the London ring. In fact, a pugilist is not recognized
till he has made this appearance, when, if successful, he becomes a leading
star of the fancy—friends flow fast in upon him, and backers are never
wanting to support his pretensions. The fame of Turner had now made progress
in the milling circles, especially in the neighbourhood of Bermondsey,
where the capabilities of Turner were best known and appreciated. Curtis,
a boxer also well known in the same quarter, it seems, felt envy at the growing
reputation of Ned, and repeatedly challenged the latter before he agreed
to meet him in combat. Curtis was of importance to the admirers of pugilism
from the laurels he had acquired in the ring. Tom Roe, West Country
Dick, and Lazarus, the Jew, had all been defeated by him. As a game
boxer his character was firmly established; in short, of the ‘light weights,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>a better bit of stuff was not thought to exist upon the list. A match was at
length made between Turner and Curtis for 100 guineas; but the betting was
current seven to four, and, in many instances, two to one upon the latter.
Indeed, so sanguine were the partizans of Curtis, that they roundly asserted
Turner could not stand half an hour before him. In a twenty feet ring, at
Moulsey Hurst, on Tuesday, October 22, 1816, the above heroes met. The
morning proving wet, the spectators were not so numerous as usual. At
half past one o’clock Curtis entered the ring, attended by Oliver, who came
on purpose from Carlisle to second his friend, assisted by Clark. Curtis
threw up his hat. Turner soon followed, attended by Tom Owen and Jacobs.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The combatants, upon setting-to,
exhibited great caution, and each appeared
anxious to obtain the first advantage.
Turner at length got an opening, and with
much dexterity planted a severe hit in Curtis’s
face, without receiving a return. The
former made another successful hit, when
they fought their way up to the ropes, and
Curtis was sent down. The three and two
to one betters seemed rather astonished at
the novice (as Turner had been termed)
commencing in such a milling style. It
augured much mischief, and the safety of
the thing was not now looked upon as quite
so certain.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The lead was again on the side of
Turner. He nobbed Curtis with evident
superiority, when the latter slipped and fell
down. (The odds began to shake, even at
this early period of the battle.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Some good blows were exchanged, but
materially to the advantage of Turner. The
claret was seen trickling down the face of
Curtis, who was ultimately thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Turner commenced offensive operations
with a severe blow from the right. He
appeared a troublesome customer for Curtis
to get at, and some long sparring occurred.
A good round, but Curtis was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Curtis could not make any impression
upon his adversary, when he retreated to the
ropes, where he received severe fibbing
punishment; but he succeeded in throwing
Turner.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Turner put in so heavy a facer that
the claret flowed in torrents, and with the
rapidity of lightning he put in another successful
blow, which sent Curtis out of the
ring. (Even betting.)</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—By this time Turner had done sufficient
work to convince the spectators that he
was the leading boxer. He was compelled
to follow his opponent to get a hit, which he
never failed to do when the ropes stopped
Curtis from retreating farther. In struggling
to obtain the throw the latter got
Turner down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—It seemed to be the aim of Curtis to
plant body blows, but he frequently hit short.
Curtis was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Curtis, in point of science, did not
appear anything equal to his opponent, except
in throwing; he now sent Turner under
the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—On the part of Turner much coolness
and judgment prevailed. He threw Curtis
in great style, and did not go down himself.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—The left hand of Turner, upon setting-to,
reached over the guard of Curtis with
such severity that the latter was floored.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—This was a short round. Turner
went round from a slip, and fell to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Curtis put in a body blow, but in so
doing he received a severe facer. A few
hits were exchanged, and both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—The decided superiority of Turner in
this round was evident. He hit Curtis in all
directions, till he went away staggering like
a man intoxicated, and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Curtis could not protect his nob from
the left hand of his opponent. In closing,
both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Curtis, with much resolution, fought
his way into a sort of scuffle, when they both
got upon the ropes. In this situation Turner
had the superiority of hitting, till they
both went down. (Turner was now decidedly
the favourite, and six to four was
offered upon him.)</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Curtis missed his aim and turned
round. In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—The left hand of Turner was continually
in Curtis’s face; and the latter, in
going down, unfortunately fell forward upon
the ropes, hanging by his chin.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—The nob of Curtis was again the object
of punishment. In closing, both fell on
the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—The milling Turner administered to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>his opponent in this round was truly terrific.
Curtis did nothing but receive; and in closing,
he was severely fibbed till he went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Curtis was so closely pursued, that
he turned round and was hit out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—This was a good round. Curtis
changed his mode of attack. In making
play he slipped down, but instantly got upon
his legs, and put in two sharp blows. Both
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Curtis hit short; but, in closing, he
seized hold of the hands of Turner. The
latter was ultimately thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—The nob of Curtis appeared much
damaged. The latter, in retreating from
his antagonist, fell, and knocked Oliver also
down, who was resting upon one knee.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Some blows were exchanged, when
Turner put in a right-handed hit that floored
Curtis.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—A close soon took place, but the combatants
disengaged themselves, when some
severe fighting passed between them, till
both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—Turner got Curtis on the ropes and
fibbed severely till he went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—Curtis, it was evident, could not stop
the mischief which the left hand of Turner
was continually doing him, and he went
down from a sharp hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—In this round Curtis threw his opponent,
but he received much punishment before
he accomplished it.</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—There was nothing attractive about
Curtis in this fight, except his taking
qualities, which he exhibited in a very eminent
degree. He returned well, but was at
length hit down.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—Curtis had the best of this round.
He gave Turner so severe a facer that sent
him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—Sparring for advantage. Curtis hit
short. In closing, both down, but the latter
undermost. The length of Turner prevented
Curtis from going in with any success.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—Turner put in three successive hits,
without any return, and Curtis went down.
The latter could not make a hit without
boring in, and then he paid for his temerity.</p>

<p class='c022'>34.—Curtis bled copiously on appearing at
the scratch. Some exchanges took place,
and both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>35.—This was an excellent round, and
both the combatants upon the alert. The
advantage was most completely on the side
of Turner, who used both hands so successfully
that Curtis was milled down.</p>

<p class='c022'>36.—Merely struggling to obtain the throw,
and both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>37.—Curtis hit short at the body, when
they fought their way to the ropes, and the
latter held Turner’s hands. They broke
away, exchanged a few blows, and both went
down. Curtis threw away a great number
of hits.</p>

<p class='c022'>38.—Of no consequence. Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>39.—Turner put in two severe facers,
without any return. Some exchanges occurred
till both went down. During this
round Owen gave directions to Turner respecting
his mode of fighting, and told him
to “hit out.”</p>

<p class='c022'>40.—Turner followed Curtis all over the
ring, nobbed him with the most perfect ease,
put in four successive blows with his left
hand, and finished the round by flooring his
antagonist.</p>

<p class='c022'>41.—This was a truly singular round.
Curtis ran in furiously and seized so fast
hold of the wrists of Turner that he could
not disengage himself from this awkward
situation. He at length slung Curtis completely
round, when the latter lost his hold.</p>

<p class='c022'>42.—In closing, Turner fibbed his opponent
down. Curtis could not resist the overwhelming
length of his adversary; and,
although things seemed so much against
him, still he did not want for resolution.</p>

<p class='c022'>43.—Curtis, from the repeated punishment
he had received, seemed quite abroad, and
totally at a loss how to make a hit. He
kept continually retreating from his adversary,
till he was sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>44.—Curtis again seized hold of his opponent’s
hands; when Turner released himself
he floored his antagonist. Every person
seemed surprised at the conduct of Curtis—it
was desperation personified.</p>

<p class='c022'>45.—It was all up with Curtis as to fighting.
He had not the slightest chance of
winning. In struggling, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>46.—Curtis came to the scratch boldly,
and put in a casual hit, but he was soon sent
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>47.—Turner hit Curtis with such severity
upon his face that he staggered and fell.
Turner stepped over him, and looked at his
prostrate antagonist.</p>

<p class='c022'>48.—The gameness of Curtis prompted
him to go on, and he endeavoured to tire out
his adversary. It was a sharp struggle to
obtain the throw.</p>

<p class='c022'>49.—A short round, and both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>50.—It was mere protraction on the part
of Curtis, and his friends requested him to
resign the contest; but he would not listen
to anything like defeat. Turner made some
successful hits. In struggling, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>51.—On setting to Curtis slipped down.</p>

<p class='c022'>52.—The left hand of Turner by a slight
hit sent Curtis off his legs.</p>

<p class='c022'>53.—The head of Curtis was bleeding
copiously. His sight was growing defective,
and the blows he attempted to make were
out of distance. However, in closing, Curtis
got Turner down.</p>

<p class='c022'>54 to 57.—In these four rounds Curtis
scarcely set-to before he was either sent or
went down. (Any odds on Turner.)</p>

<p class='c022'>58.—Curtis seemed to think it was not all
over with him and desperately bored in to
punish his adversary; but this only occasioned
extra milling. In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>59.—Curtis on the same tack, but he was
soon stopped and thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>60.—Curtis was all desperation, but sent
down almost upon setting to.</p>

<p class='c022'>61.—The left hand of Turner was again
punishing his opponent’s face; but, in closing,
Turner dropped him with such ease and
forbearance, as to obtain applause from all
parts of the ring.</p>

<p class='c022'>62.—It was evident from the strange manner
in which Curtis attacked his adversary
that he was nearly in a state of darkness.
In running at Turner he passed by him,
turned round confusedly, and was floored.
Many of Curtis’s friends were sanguine
enough to think that he might be enabled to
tire out his adversary by his determined
resolution.</p>

<p class='c022'>63.—It was astonishing to view what a
bottom man could effect. Notwithstanding
the dreadful state Curtis was reduced to,
and distressed beyond imagination, he struggled
with Turner, and ultimately threw him;
but still no change appeared.</p>

<p class='c022'>64.—This desperate mode of going in was
acted upon too late. The strength of Curtis
was fast leaving him, and he could now
scarcely make a push at his opponent with
any degree of certainty; while Turner was
so much at his ease, that he administered
scarcely any additional punishment, and behaved
to his brave adversary with much
consideration and humanity.</p>

<p class='c022'>65.—Curtis, with great desperation, again
tried to hold Turner’s hands; but he was
hit down.</p>

<p class='c022'>66.—In this round a trifling demur was
nearly taking place. In closing, a struggle
occurred, when Turner, to disengage himself,
caught Curtis by the thighs and threw
him. A cry of “foul!” “fair!” was loudly
vociferated; but the umpire did not pay any
attention to it. Curtis was literally in a
state of stupor.</p>

<p class='c022'>67.—Curtis on setting to was instantly
sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>68 and last.—It was piteous to view this
little game cock of the true English breed
endeavour to fight another round. He immediately
went down. On being placed
upon his second’s knee his head dropped on
one side. He was insensible when the
“time” was called; while, on the contrary,
his brave opponent, excepting two heavy
hits on the ear, was not materially injured.
The fight continued one hour and twenty-five
minutes, and finished five minutes before
three o’clock.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—In this conflict Turner proved
himself a steady scientific boxer: there was
nothing hurried in his manner, and he used
his left hand with celerity and decision.
Instead of appearing a novice, he showed
himself a superior up-hill boxer to Curtis.
He took the lead and kept it; supported not
only by length and strength, but was by far
the best fighter. His position was so formidable,
and his mode of setting to so different
from pugilists in general, that Curtis
could not get at him with anything like
safety to make a hit. The knowing ones
were completely outwitted upon this event,
which ought to operate as a useful lesson, by
inducing them to calculate the capabilities
of the combatants, instead of being led
astray by the mere greatness of names.
Three to one is dangerous betting at all
times.</p>

<p class='c013'>Notwithstanding the greatest exertion and humane care were taken in
speedily removing Curtis from the ring, after the battle had terminated—in
fact, but a few minutes had elapsed before he was put to bed at the Red Lion
Inn, Hampton, and medical assistance procured—yet this brave, but unfortunate
boxer, in the course of a few hours breathed his last. The subject of
his death having come under the cognizance of the laws of the country, an
inquisition was taken on the body at the above inn, on Friday, October 25,
1816, before Thomas Stirling, Esq., Coroner for Middlesex.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Griffinhoof, surgeon, of Hampton, deposed to being sent for on Tuesday
evening to attend upon the deceased, who, when he arrived, was in a state of
insensibility. There were no blows upon the body which, in his opinion,
could have caused a man’s death. There was a general discoloration from
the waist upwards. He bled him in the arm, and applied leeches to his
temples, and also endeavoured to administer to him a draught. He was of
opinion that the blows which he received on the head were the cause of his
death. The deceased lived until twelve o’clock at night.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>Mr. Morris Jones, surgeon, of Hampton, gave similar evidence. He
believed that a blood-vessel had broken in his head, and the only hopes he
had of his recovery was by his bleeding profusely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard Coombe, fishmonger, of Hampton, was present at the fight
between the deceased and Turner. It was a pitched battle. He never heard
of there being any quarrel between Curtis and Turner; saw Curtis enter the
ring at half past one o’clock; Turner entered directly after. They stripped,
shook hands, and then commenced fighting. When they had fought more
than an hour, witness went up to Curtis and advised him to give in; but he
observed that he could see, and should beat his opponent yet. He said his
seconds advised Curtis not to fight any longer, and forced him to the ropes,
but he broke from them and faced Turner again. The third round after he
forced himself from his seconds, Turner gave him a heavy blow, which
threw him, and fell upon him. He was raised up by his seconds, and the
battle ended. Turner was declared the conqueror. He was informed that
Curtis had been, previous to the fight about a month, unwell with a certain
disease, and had been under the care of two physicians of St. Thomas’s
Hospital. His friends, thinking him not in a sound state, advised him not to
fight; but Curtis was determined. He never saw a fairer fight. Turner
could have struck him several times between the fiftieth and sixty-eighth
(last) rounds, when he would not, on account of his having such an advantage
over his opponent. At one time he stood over Curtis as he leaned
against the ropes, and might have given him a violent blow, having him
wholly in his power; instead of doing so he lifted up his hands and walked
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another witness, also sworn, observed, that for about twelve rounds before
the termination of the contest, he told Curtis he had no chance to win, and
that it was a pity he should suffer himself to be beaten to pieces. The reply
of the deceased was, that he could not lose the battle, and he maintained this
assertion against every remonstrance, until he fell in the last round, and never
recovered from a state of stupor. Oliver, his second, advised him also, in
vain, to resign long before the battle was decided, and the umpire refused to
hold the watch any longer; but the deceased entertained a notion that he
could win until the moment he fell. The evidence of this witness went to
explain on the subject of the fall. He stated that, in the struggle for
superiority, both men were down, and that Turner had an opportunity of
doing mischief to his adversary, by falling upon him, but he broke from him
and behaved in a manly manner, as he had done in other instances during
the fight. After this fall, Curtis never recovered from the stupor, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>witness believed him to be in a dying state before he reached the inn at
Hampton.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was further sworn that Turner had forborne to take advantage of his
adversary when he had him upon the ropes, and that he showed much fair
play during the combat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Coroner summed up:—Gentlemen of the jury, I have read over the
whole of the evidence which has been adduced, and it is now my duty to
point out to you what is the chief point for you to consider with regard to
your verdict. It is proved there was no previous quarrel between Turner and
the unfortunate deceased before their contest at Moulsey Hurst; but, notwithstanding,
it is my duty to tell you that the meeting was unlawful, for Turner
had no right to beat Curtis until he died because he had his consent, although
they did not agree to fight till one had killed the other: yet such was the
fact in evidence, that the extremities of Curtis were dead before he left the
ring. There are certainly several points in favour of Turner. It appears
that he could several times, when he did not, have not only disabled the
deceased, but that he had him at one time so much in his power that he
could have put an end to the contest, but that he avoided the opportunity of
an advantage: still the deceased died in consequence of the wounds he
received from Turner. I have stated what appears in favour of Turner; and,
on the other side, that he acted unlawfully, and you cannot discharge your
duty, in my opinion, unless you find him guilty in some degree—to what
degree it is for you to determine. The jury were in consultation for twenty
minutes, when they returned a verdict of manslaughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the issuing of the warrant, Turner at once surrendered himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Friday, November 1, 1816, at the Old Bailey Sessions, Edward Turner
was indicted for the wilful murder of John Curtis, by inflicting with both
his hands divers blows, on the 22nd of October, whereof he died.</p>

<p class='c007'>The witnesses gave the same evidence as that before the coroner. Turner
being called upon for his defence, read from a written paper as follows:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury</span></p>

<p class='c018'>“Deeply impressed with the great peril to which I am exposed by the present charge
made against me, and with the difficulty I necessarily experience in substantiating my innocence,
owing to the danger to which most competent witnesses of the transaction would be
exposed, were they to be examined, I must solicit your serious attention to such facts as I
shall be enabled to lay before you, by which I trust not only my natural disposition will appear,
but that on the occasion of the sad catastrophe imputed to me I was goaded into a consent
to fight the deceased, who was himself a prize-fighter, and with the greatest reluctance I
entered the ring, after being assaulted; and when I did so, as soon as I ascertained my
superiority over my antagonist, I forbore on very many occasions, to avail myself of the
advantages that presented themselves to me, and with the greatest reluctance continued the
contest until the circumstance occurred which led to the unfortunate event which I must
ever deplore, and which has placed me in my present awful situation. I beg to state that
my pursuits in life are honest, my aversion to prize-fighting great, never having before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>fought a pitched battle; nor should I on this occasion, but for the great aggravation which
will be proved I received. I assure your Lordships and gentlemen of the Jury, that I am
totally innocent of any intention to seriously injure the deceased, and that there never
existed in my mind the smallest particle of malice towards him. I trust, therefore, that my
character for humanity and forbearance will have its due weight on this occasion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>During the time the clerk of the arraigns was reading the defence, the
feelings of Turner were so oppressed that he was observed to shed tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>His counsel, Mr. Andrews (who had scarcely time to look over his brief,
in consequence of Mr. Adolphus not being in court, although retained some
days previous to the trial for Turner) then proceeded to call a multitude of
witnesses, all of whom gave him an excellent character for humanity and
mildness of disposition. Some of them stated that he had never fought a
prize battle before, and that he was urged to the contest by the frequent
importunities of the deceased, who was not easy until he obtained his promise
to fight him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baron Graham, in charging the jury, said this was not a case accompanied
by any circumstances that indicated previous malice on the part of the
prisoner. It appeared from the evidence that the prisoner was not one of
those men who devoted themselves to the dangerous profession of prize-fighting.
He was, it seemed, considered to be a young man of boxing skill and
prowess, a victory over whom would increase the fame of his opponent, and
therefore he was urged, nay, goaded, to fight the battle which ended so
lamentably. There was certainly premeditation enough on his part to make
the crime murder, provided the parties had fought with dangerous weapons,
which were likely to produce death. The law was quite certain and decided
on this point. For if people met (a smaller period even than a day having
expired between their quarrel and their meeting) to fight with deadly
weapons, and death ensued, then that was murder, because what the law
called malice was apparent—the act was done in cold blood. The present
appeared to have been a display of manhood and courage; and whilst they
disapproved of such a rencontre between two young men, they could not feel
that horror (this being a trial of natural courage and manhood) which, under
other circumstances, they might entertain. Under the circumstances stated,
the prisoner and the deceased met to fight on the 22nd of October; but they
met to fight with those natural arms which, certainly, when strong men were
opposed to each other, might produce fatal effects, yet were not in general
likely to occasion dreadful consequences, and the contemplation of which
could not excite those feelings which deadly and dangerous weapons were
calculated to produce. It seemed evident that nothing like malice existed in
the mind of the prisoner. It was, as he had before observed, a trial of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>prowess: no malice appeared, at least on the part of the prisoner. He did
not wish to cast any reflection on the memory of a dead man; but, looking
strictly to the circumstances, perhaps the imputation of an angry feeling
might rest on the deceased. It was in evidence that, during the contest of
nearly an hour and a half, the prisoner had cautiously and humanely avoided
using, to the extent he might have done, the decided advantage and superiority
which he had over the deceased. There was nothing in his conduct
like deliberate cruelty, or a desire to injure his adversary, farther than the
result occasioned by his efforts to show himself the better man. Water, it
appeared, had frequently been thrown upon the deceased in the course of the
fight, he having previously taken large quantities of a very powerful medicine
(mercury). But a medical gentleman had stated that such ablutions
could not have materially affected him at that time; and perhaps, considering
the exertions he was making, they might have refreshed him. The prisoner
evidently showed that humanity which did him credit and honour. It
appeared that he greatly regretted being obliged to continue the fight, in
consequence of the determination of the deceased. The principal part of the
charge, therefore, that of murder, was quite out of the question; but there could
be no doubt of the killing and slaying, which the law considered a very high
offence. The consequence had indeed been fatal to that unhappy young
man; but it would be extremely unjust to say Turner was responsible for
those consequences, as being the cause of them. It was a fact, unquestionably
true, that Turner had no hostility whatever to the deceased, for, on the
contrary, he had shown himself actuated by the purest motives of humanity
during the whole contest; and, likewise, the numerous previous insults the
deceased had offered to Turner, were long and painfully endured without any
retaliation. This was honourable to his patience. The taking away the life
of the young man by the prisoner was clearly proved; for the surgeon had
stated that death had ensued, as he had expected, in consequence of the
injuries he had received.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jury, after a short consideration, returned a verdict of Manslaughter
against the prisoner, but earnestly recommended him to the merciful consideration
of the court, on account of his humanity and forbearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Baron Graham observed that the court participated in the feelings of
the jury.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of the Sessions Turner was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment
in Newgate.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the confinement of Turner he conducted himself with so much propriety
and decorum as to merit the attention of the head keeper, who granted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>him every indulgence consistent with the rules of the place. He was also
visited by many of the highest patrons of pugilism.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after his liberation, Turner, by the advice of his friends, took a
benefit at the Minerva Rooms, Leadenhall Street, as a means of contributing
towards the heavy expenses he had sustained from his trial and imprisonment.
The amateurs rallied round him upon this occasion in gratifying numbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sporting circles of this period were extremely anxious to bring about a
match between the all-conquering Scroggins and Turner; but the friends of
Turner insisting that Scroggins should not exceed ten stone seven pounds on
coming into the ring, the match was for a long time off, until the following
accidental circumstance produced a battle, after the previous regular propositions
of bringing them together had failed.</p>

<p class='c007'>At a sporting dinner which took place at the Castle Tavern, Holborn, on
Wednesday, February 26, 1817, Mr. Emery, of Covent Garden Theatre, in
the chair, Turner and Scroggins were among the visitors. In consequence of
the deputy chairman being absent, Scroggins was requested to fill up the
vacancy. This little hero had just returned from the Fives Court, after
setting to with Tom Belcher, in which display with the gloves he had been
much applauded; being somewhat warmed, and not standing upon the punctilio
of waiting for the toasts, he rallied his bottle in such quick succession that
he was completely floored. Shortly afterwards the effects of exertion and the
glass combined operated so somniferously on the upper works of Scroggy,
that he laid down his head and went to sleep. The company were rather
amused than offended with this inactive state of their deputy, and he was
permitted to enjoy the benefit of his slumbers. On waking, he quitted the
chair and introduced himself to the company below stairs in the coffee-room.
Turner soon afterwards took his leave of the dinner party, and on his way
home through the house he took a peep, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</span></i>, at the room below stairs.
It is fair to observe that Scroggins was in a state of inebriation. The company
remonstrated upon the impropriety of Scroggins’ behaviour, who was
quarrelling with and threatening to mill ould Joe Norton. Turner civilly
remarked that Norton was an old man, his time was gone by, and as to his
fighting it was quite out of the question. Scroggins, with much asperity, abused
Turner for his observation, called him everything but a good one, and sneeringly
told Ned that he had never defeated any body; indeed, only “licked a
man that was half dead with disease before he entered the ring.” This produced
a sharp retort from Turner, when Scroggins gave the former a slap in
the face. A turn-up was the immediate consequence, but scarcely a blow
passed before they were both down, and Turner undermost. Sutton instantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>got between them; the company also interfered, and peace was restored.
The account of this fracas flew up stairs like lightning, and the amateurs
immediately discussed the subject. Scroggins, with derision, offered to fight
Turner £100 to £50; but the latter felt all this was empty boasting. It
was the general opinion of those present that Turner had been unhandsomely
treated by Scroggins; and, in consequence, Mr. Soares, on the part of Turner,
immediately made a deposit of five guineas towards making a match in a
month from that time, although Mr. S. had, in every previous instance, supported
Scroggins. On Wednesday, the 12th of March, the partisans of both
heroes met at Belcher’s, and the stakes were made good. But Scroggins was
the “idol” of the sporting world, and it was a censure upon any one’s
judgment to name Turner as having anything like a chance; indeed, infatuation
was carried to such a pitch of extravagance, respecting the overwhelming
capabilities of Scroggins, that the Jew Phenomenon never stood upon
higher ground in the best of his days.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible to describe the sensation this fight occasioned in the sporting
circles; the fame of Scroggins, from his having conquered Boots, Dolly
Smith, Nosworthy, Eales, Whittaker, and Church, in succession, had made
such a strong impression on the minds of the fancy in general, that he was
thought almost invulnerable. Even Scroggins himself felt impressed with
the same idea, and fought £100 against Turner’s £50. It is true the match
was first made when Scroggins was not exactly <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">compos mentis</span></i>; but, in his
soberest moments, he boldly asserted he would win it with ease. The capabilities
of Turner he positively ridiculed, treated him as a mere upstart pugilistic
pretender, and flattered himself that the prowess of Turner would vanish
before his punishing arm, like snow before the sun. For three nights previous
to the battle taking place, the sporting houses were crowded to excess,
and so very high did this modern Dutch Sam stand in the estimation of the
knowing ones, that nothing less than three to one would be accepted, and
that only from an idea that a chance hit or accident might operate against
his usual success. On Wednesday, March 26, 1817, as soon as it was light,
groups of pedestrians were seen on the Uxbridge Road; and by eight o’clock
carriages of all descriptions were rattling along, from the splendid barouche
and four down to the donkey and hampers. By eleven twenty thousand
persons had collected on the ground, a field near Hayes, between the bridge
and the turnpike, not far from the present line of the Great Western Railroad,
about ten miles on the Uxbridge Road from Tyburn turnpike. At
eighteen minutes to one Turner appeared in the ring, dressed in a fashionable
great coat, and threw up his hat, and Scroggins immediately followed. Cribb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>tied the yellow handkerchief belonging to Turner to the stake, and Oliver
immediately placed the blue fogle of Scroggins beside it. The combatants
shook hands before they stripped. Oliver and Clarke appeared as seconds to
Scroggins; the Champion of England and Harry Harmer attended upon
Turner. Three to one was the current betting against the latter, and many
thousands depended on the event. Turner was an object of great curiosity,
from his late unfortunate battle with Curtis; but viewed as the antagonist of
Scroggins, the idea was sneered at. The ring measured twenty-four feet,
and the numerous carriages round it formed an elegant amphitheatre. Lord
Yarmouth and Colonel Barton acted as timekeepers.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—It was expected, on the combatants
setting-to, that Scroggins would
adopt his usual method of boring in to his
adversary, or, to use his own words, “take
the fight out of him;” but he was more
cautious than usual, and a good deal of
sparring took place. He made a feint at
Turner, and instantly got away again. At
length Scroggins put in a hit—some trifling
blows passed between them, and ultimately
Turner went down lightly, when Scroggins
held up his hands, by way of showing how
little he thought of him.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Scroggins now appeared a little more
on the alert to follow up his success; he gave
Turner a sharp nobber, but he failed in
doing his usual punishing execution. The
customer before him was not of that easy
description he had flattered himself, and
though Turner went down, it was not from
effective hitting. (Many persons exclaimed,
“Now where’s your three to one?”)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Turner, on setting-to, fought with his
opponent manfully, and planted a severe
facer under his left eye; and though, at the
close of the round, he was again down, his
capabilities as a boxer were manifest. He
also met with great encouragement from the
spectators.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—This was a sharply contested round;
both were at work in right earnest, and in a
close Turner gave his opponent a severe
cross-buttock. The concourse of persons
was so great, and their eager curiosity not
keeping pace with the etiquette usual upon
these occasions, pressed forward to the ropes—the
outer ring was broken, and all traces
of the fight lost sight of, excepting to a few,
who, at the hazard of their lives, kept in
front.</p>

<p class='c022'>The men continued to fight for several
rounds under this disadvantage, when the
inner and smaller ring was broken into, the
stakes knocked down, and the ropes trodden
under foot. It was now more like a street
row than a prize fight, and the combatants
had scarcely a yard of space. Scroggins,
notwithstanding being so close to Turner,
had by no means the best of him, and it was
the general opinion, that had no interruption
occurred Turner would have won. To
attempt to describe any of these rounds with
accuracy would be a deviation from the
truth; and Mr. Jackson afterwards declared
it was totally out of his power to give an
opinion upon them. Carter, Painter, Dolly
Smith, Richmond, etc., exerted themselves
with their horsewhips to beat out the ring,
but in vain; nothing less than a troop of
horse or a company of soldiers with fixed
bayonets could have attempted it with success.
Both men were accordingly taken
from the ring, and Mr. Jackson went round,
declaring all the bets to be null and void.
At this period not less than thirty thousand
persons were present, and the carriages on
the spot and along the road were estimated
at eight thousand. A suspense of two hours
occurred, and thousands of inquiries took
place to ascertain how the day was to be
finished. During this interval, the costermongers
wishing to clear their carts, but not
being able to persuade the customers (who
had paid 3s. a-piece to see the sports of the
day) to retire from their situations, actually
took out their horses and lifted up their
vehicles, after the manner of shooting rubbish.
This mode of ousting the tenants
occasioned much laughter, and a little extra
boxing. At length Mr. Jackson appeared,
when it was announced that the contest was
adjourned to a future day.</p>

<p class='c022'>Turner proved himself a much more competent
boxer than was expected, and Scroggins
was equally deceived. Turner convinced
Scroggins that his furious onslaught
was to be stopped. He hit him once so tremendously
on the jaw, that the latter held
up his head afterwards, and did not go boring
in so furiously as heretofore. They were
both fresh on leaving the ring, but neither
of them were considered in good condition.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Scroggins had a black eye, and one of Turner’s
peepers was a little out of repair. It
is but fair to state that much difference of
opinion existed on the subject, many persons
contending that Scroggins was not in the
slightest degree punished, and that Turner
showed evident symptoms of weakness on
leaving the ring. Several noblemen were
present, and many first-rate theatricals. It
proved a rare day for the inn-keepers and
pike-men, and it was impossible to move a
step, where the pocket was concerned, without
dearly paying for curiosity.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the Monday evening after the fight every room to the top of Belcher’s
house was crowded to excess by the “Fancy,” so anxious were the amateurs
to learn the decision as regarded the coming battle. The following articles
were agreed to:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c010'>

<p class='c013'>So confident, it appears, were the partisans of Scroggins that victory would
again crown his exertions, that no fall whatever in the betting took place
from his unexpected battle in a room with Fisher, when in a state of inebriation;
in fact, it operated materially in his favour. This rencontre will be
found under the memoir of <span class='sc'>Scroggins</span>, Chapter IX., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of the Ascot race week falling at the time appointed in the
articles (May 27), the battle was, by mutual consent, postponed to the 10th
of June. Notwithstanding the secrecy observed, the magistrates of Essex got
hint enough not to permit Matching Green to be the spot, as fixed upon for
this trial of skill to be decided. The attraction in the sporting circles was so
great that vehicles of all descriptions were on the road the whole of Monday
night; and as soon as daylight began to peep on Tuesday morning the
amateurs were in motion. Upon their arrival at Harlow, the interruption
was found out, and after a short deliberation it was decided that the battle
should take place in the adjoining county, Hertfordshire, in a paddock contiguous
to Sawbridgeworth. Thither the cavalcade posted without delay,
and the inhabitants of that quiet village were not a little astonished at this
sudden visit from galloping horsemen, rattling post-chaises, barouches, tilburys,
carts, etc., till the important cause was learned. It was a profound
secret here, notwithstanding Turner slept at Mr. Parsons’, the White Lion
Inn, Sawbridgeworth, the preceding evening. He arrived from New Town
in Wales, where he had been in training under the care of his uncle, Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>Turner, and reached Barnet on Friday evening <em>incog.</em> He scarcely saw five
persons before he entered the ring, being under the immediate care of his
cousin, Mr. Baxter. He was in much better condition than when he stripped
at Hayes; but it is certain he still might have been brought to a finer pitch.
He weighed ten stone five pounds. On meeting with his opponent, Scroggins,
they shook hands in the most friendly manner together. The stakes,
as before stated, were £120 on the part of Scroggins, against Turner’s £80.
At half past twelve Turner appeared in the twenty-four feet roped ring, and
threw up his hat. Scroggins soon followed his example. Tom Owen and
Jacobs were the seconds of Turner; and Harmer and Clark attended upon
Scroggins. Owen tied the yellow colour of his man upon the post, and
Harmer covered it with the true blue belonging to Scroggins. It is curious
to remark that this same blue handkerchief belonging to the latter he had
won all his seven battles in, but now he sported a new one round him. The
ring was unusually respectable and select, not being above one deep, few, if
any, pedestrians being able to go the distance of thirty miles in time. One
o’clock having arrived, the parties shook hands, and the battle commenced.
Two to one on Scroggins.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Two minutes elapsed in sparring
and dodging each other round the ring,
both anxious to obtain the first advantage.
The firm and erect attitude of Turner, who
appeared armed at all points, seemed to
puzzle Scroggins so much that he was at a
loss how to commence the attack with any
degree of certainty, and that formidable
resolution of going in furiously, which gave
him the lead in the commencement of all
his other fights, in the present instance had
visibly abated. Scroggins at length, neck
or nothing, made a sort of rush in, and after
a short scuffling close, Turner went down
from a slight hit on the side of his head.
(Loud shouting, and three to one on Scroggins.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The little hero seemed pleased with
his success, and was going in with much
gaiety to reduce the confidence of Turner,
when the latter put in a sharp teazer on
Scroggins’s mug with his right hand, that
rather stopped his career; in the course of
the round he planted another desperate facer,
and added a severe hit on the ribs. In closing,
the strength of Scroggy prevailed, and
Turner was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Scroggins seemed, in this early stage
of the fight, to anticipate that he had a
very ugly customer before him, and appeared
unusually cautious. Several good
hits passed, but in closing, Turner was again
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Turner was not long before he planted
a desperate hit on the throat of his opponent,
that gave him a sort of hiccup. Scroggins
endeavoured to make some rushing hits,
but he lost his distance, and no execution
was done. In closing, both went down, but
Turner was undermost, having experienced
a cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—This round was well contested, and
Scroggins, quite determined, went in, but
Turner milled his nob sharply, and the claret
was seen trickling down his face. In closing,
Turner was again undermost. At this
instant a troop of Yeomanry Cavalry made
their appearance, galloping down the lane
towards the scene of action, creating some
alarm that the fight would again be interrupted;
but, on being interrogated, it appeared
they were admirers of native courage,
and only anxious to witness the mill.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—This was a short round. Scroggins
missed a desperately aimed blow at Turner’s
body; he, nevertheless, rushed in and hit
Turner down.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Scroggins came bleeding to the
scratch, and a good milling round occurred.
Several sharp blows were exchanged, but in
closing, Turner was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The little tar, without ceremony,
rushed headlong in, and scuffled with his
antagonist till both went down. (“Well
done, Scroggins! he’ll tire out Turner,” was
the cry.)</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>9.—On setting-to, Turner put in a tremendous
facer with his right hand, and got
away with much dexterity. Scroggins endeavoured
to return, but lost his distance,
and Turner again nobbed him. The former
appeared confused, and dropped his hands,
but at length rushed in. In closing, Turner
was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—This was a sharp round, but the coolness
of Turner was manifest, and he hit with
much judgment. He was perfectly aware of
his opponent’s mode of fighting, and always
prepared to give him a warm reception. In
closing, Turner undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Scroggins commenced this round
with considerable caution, and nearly a
minute occurred before a blow was struck.
Turner’s left hand claimed an acquaintance
with Scroggy’s cheek. Scroggins in return
endeavoured to plant a hit at Turner’s mark,
that, had it proved successful, might have
materially changed the face of the battle.
He, nevertheless, in closing, again sent Turner
over the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—This was a tremendous round; the
combatants rallied in grand style. In closing,
Turner fibbed his man terribly, and for
the first time the little hero was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—From the severe fibbing Scroggins
had received after setting-to he hastily retreated;
loud hissing arose from all parts of
the ring. But he soon recovered from his
panic, and it was as sharp a round as any in
the fight. Turner gave his opponent a hit
that sent him quite round; but Scroggins
again opposed him with the most determined
spirit, and followed him till, in closing, both
went down. (Turner was now evidently the
favourite.)</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Turner immediately planted a facer
on setting-to. (Applause.) Scroggins also
made a hit, and Turner went down from it,
as if he had slipped.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Smashing hits on both sides, but
many of them out of distance. Scroggins
was again fibbed, but he stopped this sort of
punishment by holding the hands of Turner.
He also obtained the throw, and Turner was
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—On setting-to, Scroggins got back,
and Turner put down his hands, convincing
his opponent he had leisure enough to wait
for him. Turner at length planted a desperate
ribber, and Scroggins furiously bored in.
In closing, the latter again obtained his
usual advantage.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—This was a curious round. Scroggins,
on receiving a hit, turned round, but
furiously renewed the combat. Turner, in
closing, had the advantage materially in fibbing
his opponent, yet Scroggins got him
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Turner, with much coolness, nobbed
Scroggins and got away. The latter seemed
quite at fault: he was at sea without a
rudder—no sight of land appeared in view,
and desperation seemed his only resource.
Scroggy rushed in again on the bull-dog
system, and ultimately succeeded in getting
Turner undermost. During this round Clark,
Scroggins’ second, fell down in a fit, and
was succeeded by Ned Painter.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Scroggins made a good body hit, and
smashed away with much spirit. He was
manfully opposed by Turner, but the latter
ultimately went down, and almost a second
had elapsed when Scroggy fell with all his
weight upon him. Some marks of disapprobation,
but it might have been accident.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Turner, with considerable ease,
planted a right-handed hit on the already
chanceried nob of Scroggins, and got away;
but the latter, to revenge this attack, rushed
in with uncommon ardour to make a change,
if possible, and while endeavouring to put in
some tremendous blows, received a slight hit
that caused him to fall and slip out of the
ring.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Some heavy hits were dealt out on
both sides, and Turner, in particular, received
one so severe on the right side of his
nob, that for a second it was almost upon his
shoulder. In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—This was positively the best round in
the fight; the blows were heard all round
the ring. A desperate rally occurred, and
the men broke away; but Scroggins, not
satisfied that he had done enough, endeavoured
to go in head foremost to take the
fight out of his opponent. Turner, prepared
for his impetuosity, hit upwards as he was
coming in, upon his throat, with great effect.
In closing, both down, Turner undermost.
Scroggins, on his second’s knee, hemmed for
wind, and he also discharged a considerable
quantity of the crimson fluid from his mouth.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Scroggins rushed in, and both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Things had now materially changed,
and five and six to one were freely offered on
Turner. On Scroggins reaching the scratch
his knees trembled under him, and he appeared
like a man intoxicated. He endeavoured
to plant a hit, and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Turner gave him a left handed facer,
and also a severe ribber with his right.
Scroggins was quite abroad; he could make
no hit with any degree of certainty, and
once more resorted to boring in, till both
went down. The combatants were close
together while sitting on the knees of their
seconds, when Turner laid hold of his opponent’s
hand and gave it a friendly shake.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—On setting-to Turner planted a
dreadful facer, and soon after hit Scroggins
clean down. (Seven to one was offered.)
Brandy was now called for to renovate the
little hero, but it was of no avail.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—On coming to the scratch, after a
slight hit from Turner, Scroggins turned
round and retreated till he got to a corner of
the ring. Turner stood still, pointing his
finger at him and beckoning him to come up
and fight, but it would not do. Turner was
compelled to follow Scroggins, when they
closed. Severe fibbing was again dealt out
to him, till both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>28.—Turner left the knee of his second in
a most lively manner, but Scroggins seemed
to come very reluctantly to the point of war.
Scroggins threw away his blows, and he
received some dreadful up-hits in his throat
that electrified him.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—Scroggins was brought to the mark,
and he had scarcely lifted up his hands when
he was hit down. (Ten to one offered freely.)</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—The nob of Scroggins now appeared
much damaged, and his ribs exhibited a
token of severe punishment. But though
the little hero was prevented from doing any
mischief, he nevertheless contended for the
throw, and obtained it.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—The superiority of Turner astonished
all present. He made a successful hit with
his right hand on the face of Scroggins, and
instantly made another good one upon his
ribs. The little hero turned round in a state
of confusion, and was sent down. (Great
applause. Five to three offered that Scroggins
did not fight three more rounds.)</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—Scroggins had been literally stupid
for the last half hour, from the heavy blows
he had received on his head, and in not
being able to stop the upper-cuts of Turner.
At out fighting in this round he was much
punished, and severely fibbed, till Turner
dropped him. (“Well done, Turner.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>33 and last.—It was all up with the sailor,
who had made so much noise in the fighting
circles for the last three years. He had been
pronounced to be almost invincible, and he
had flattered himself into the belief. In the
last ten rounds, in point of fighting, he had
no chance whatever; nevertheless he fought
with much bravery. Scroggins endeavoured
to do something in this round, put in some
hits, but turned away from his opponent
from the severity of punishment, and fell.
On being placed upon his second’s knee, he
gave in. Upon Harry Harmer hoisting the
handkerchief as a token of defeat, it is impossible
to describe the appearance of the
ring. They seemed lost in reverie, till giving
vent to their surprise, they exclaimed,
“What, Scroggins given in? Impossible!”
The battle lasted one hour and twelve
minutes. Scroggins was carried out of the
ring, and put into a post-chaise, Turner
having won almost without a scratch.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—The “Napoleon of the ring”
has at length been defeated, but not disgraced;
and, like other mighty fighting
heroes, has been taught what it is to drink
of the bitter cup of disappointment. He is
now blamed for his confidence and temerity
by those very admirers who supported him;
but it may be asked, what is a hero without
feeling confident of victory? Scroggins entered
the ring under these feelings, and
endeavoured to come out a conqueror. He
did all that a man could do; and the hero,
who defeated in succession, Boots, Dolly
Smith, Nosworthy, Eales, Whittaker,
Church, and Fisher, ought not to be forgotten
in an honourable defeat with a superior
man. Scroggins was never considered
a boxer in a scientific point of view, and this
day he completely proved the truth of the
assertion. The judgment and science were
completely on the side of Turner; he never
struggled to lose his strength in throwing,
but went down with scarcely any resistance.
He never hit first, but only when the opportunity
was undeniable. His guard was so
firm that Scroggins could never get at him
without being exposed to great danger. His
coolness was equally admirable; and, in
opposition to Scroggins, he made the ferocity
of the latter subservient to his skill. The
desperation of Scroggins, which had so terrified
his opponents hitherto, was reduced to
confusion; and the ease with which he was
conquered, astonished the most knowing
amateurs, and many of them paid dearly for
their confidence. At best, he was only a
resolute smashing fighter, and none of his
opponents, except Turner, could get away
from his severe punishment. He lost by
out-fighting with Turner, and was worse off
from going in. In the fight at Hayes, Turner
has since acknowledged, he received so
violent a blow from Scroggins that he could
not for a month afterwards open his mouth
without considerable pain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Turner was so fresh that he was able to have fought another battle, and
walked round the ring during the next fight. He drove himself to London,
and appeared so little hurt from his conflict that he returned with all the
gaiety of a spectator. The house kept by Scroggins, in Westminster, was
surrounded by hundreds of people waiting for the intelligence; and so much
confidence were the crowd inspired with in behalf of the naval hero, that his
defeat was not believed till he arrived at home about one in the morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The backers of Turner met on the Friday evening following at Belcher’s,
the Castle Tavern, Holborn, and presented him with the whole of the stakes,
amounting to £120, as a reward for his courage. Turner also paid his fallen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>opponent a friendly visit the preceding evening, when Scroggins said he
wished to retrieve his lost laurels in a new contest for £100 a side. Turner,
who had no wish to fight again, but merely as a matter of accommodation,
said he could not meet him for less than £200 a side. Scroggins attributed
his defeat to a chance blow in the throat, accompanied with getting one of
his feet into a small hole in the ground, which threw him off his balance;
and it was at that precise instant, he said, that he received the above hit,
which deprived him of his wind throughout the conflict.</p>

<p class='c007'>A short time after the above conquest Turner made a visit to New Town,
where he had recently been in training, and which is the birth-place of his
parents and relatives. He was hailed with all the respect due to a hero in a
more important cause. The companions of his youth, and the admirers of
pugilism among the Ancient Britons, caused a congratulatory peal to be rung
upon the bells in honour of his victory. A feast was held at the first inn in
the place, and two roasted fat sheep, with gilded horns, were served up with
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et ceteras</span></i>, including plenty of game. The evening was conducted with
the utmost conviviality, and the Welsh bards mustered upon this occasion
composed and sung extemporaneous verses in praise of the brave and of the
exploits of their countryman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the return of Turner to London the stakes were made good, for 300
guineas, and Scroggins, it seems, so much fancied this third trial of skill, that,
in order to train correctly, he relinquished his character as a publican, and
disposed of his house. But the opinion of the sporting world had changed,
and seven to four was the current betting upon Turner. The charm of the
invincibility of Scroggins was broken, and the great interest this little hero
once sustained in the milling circles was materially injured by his defeat.</p>

<p class='c007'>From some apparently careless conduct of Scroggins after the stakes were
made good, much doubt prevailed through the fancy respecting the battle,
and a strong opinion was maintained “that no fight would take place.”
Even three to one was betted on this particular point. This circumstance
operated as a great drawback upon the interest of the contest, and until the
evening preceding the battle very few sums were risked upon the event.
Both the combatants, however, had publicly declared it should not be their
fault if any disappointment occurred, as they were very anxious to come to a
decision upon the subject. Notwithstanding this mystery, Scroggins had not
lost his interest with the sporting world, and early on the morning appointed
for the battle the roads leading to the scene of action gave proof of it. The
ring was made at an early hour, at Shepperton; and, whether owing to
accident or intention, upon the arrival of numerous spectators at the above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>spot, it was given out “the fight will take place at Moulsey.” Thither the
motley cavalcade repaired, and the confusion that now occurred beggars
description. The flight from Shepperton through Walton was like the
retreat of an army. Those, too, who were galloping from Hampton to Shepperton
turned suddenly round upon hearing the news; the road in consequence
was blocked, the scent for a time lost, and all doubt and glorious confusion.
A strong group was at length seen forming across the water at
Moulsey, and the boats were actively employed in conveying over the
anxious spectators to be in time. It was now booked by many that no fight
would take place; and, if it did, that hundreds would not be able to see it.
The hoax, however, was dispelled, and “Shepperton” was again the signal.
The keeper of the Walton Bridge toll, anxious to come in for a slice of the
profits, put up a board at the end of a lane, “This is the road to the fight,”
and from this stratagem came in for a tolerable good share of copper; it was,
however, considerably out of the way. At length all was right, the ring was
formed, and the spectators took their stations. But another dilemma arose—the
principal actor had not arrived, and the audience waited in the most
anxious suspense. Turner had been in the ring, and thrown up his hat
without being answered. Two to one was offered it was no fight. To prevent
total disappointment, the after piece was about to be performed first,
and two youths appeared stripped. But the cry of “Scroggins, Scroggins,”
was now heard; the lads instantly made their exit, and the little hero was
greeted with welcome. Upon being asked by a friend if he meant to fight, he
answered, “Yes, and win it.” The combatants soon prepared for action, and
seven to four was laid against Scroggins, although he appeared in the best
condition. Tom Owen and Painter were for Turner, and Paddington Jones
and Spring waited upon Scroggins. The colours of the combatants were tied
to the stakes of the ring, and at two o’clock the men set-to. The articles
stipulated to meet between twelve and one, but Turner said he did not wish
to avail himself of this advantage.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—This first round was very similar
to the two last battles at Hayes and Sawbridgeworth,
but with an increase of caution
on both sides. Scroggins, it seemed, did not
like the idea of going in to smash his opponent
at the onset, after his usual decided
manner, when victory crowned his efforts in
seven successive contests, but exhibited a
total change in his tactics—a complete new
feature. This once tremendous rushing
boxer now adopted the system of getting away
of scientific pugilists. Turner, equally on
the alert, and wishing to do everything but
receive, lengthened out this round to five
minutes and a half, during which time they
dodged each other to obtain the first advantage.
Turner at last hit short; Scroggins
also made a feint without effect. Turner
was tired of his position and put down his
hands. They, however, finished the round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>by both hitting together, closed, went down,
but Turner undermost. Only four blows
were exchanged.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Turner planted two clean hits without
experiencing any return. A good rally followed,
during which the mug of Scroggins
was clareted. In closing, both down, but
Turner again undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The little hero, anxious to punish his
adversary, rushed in and planted a severe
hit under the jaws of Turner and got away.
In rallying, however, Scroggins slipped
down, and received a slight hit in falling.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Nearly a minute elapsed before a hit
was made. Turner gave two sharp blows,
and Scroggins put in a desperate nobber
just passing the ear of Turner. It was a
good round altogether. In closing, the
strength of Scroggins prevailed, and Turner
was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The great advantage Turner derived
from his height and length over his adversary
was evident to every one. Turner, with
much <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>, planted two nobbers and
got away. Some sharp blows were exchanged,
when the men separated. In
finishing the round a smart rally occurred,
and, in going down, Scroggins was undermost.
(Five to two on Turner; but little
betting occurred.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Scroggins appeared earnestly to wish
for in-fighting, but the difficulty and danger
of the attempt operated as a drawback. He,
however, made two punishing hits. In closing,
Turner caught hold of his nob and
coloured it with the quickness of a painter
with his brush. In struggling for the throw
Turner was undermost, but he gave his
opponent rather an ugly hoist.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—In this round Scroggy appeared to
advantage. He fought after his usual
method, regardless of the consequences. He
stopped Turner as he was coming in with a
tremendous hit in his face, that made his
head bob again. Scroggins also planted two
more severe blows that seemed rather to
confuse the tactics of Turner. The latter
returned heavily, and made an up-hit at his
opponent’s throat, but missed it. In closing,
both down, but Turner undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The little hero, full of gaiety, rushed
in, planted two successful hits, and bored
Turner down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—After an exchange Turner went down
from a blow on the side of the head.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—The length of Turner again prevailed.
Scroggins was desperate in action,
but not effective in execution; while, on the
contrary, Turner planted three hits in succession
on the face of his opponent, and the
claret followed at every touch. In closing,
Turner was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—This round was contested in a most
manly style. Scroggins, with uncommon
severity, hit Turner away from him in three
successive attempts, when considerable sparring
occurred. Turner then took the lead,
and the execution he performed on the head
of Scroggins was tremendous. He also
finished the round in high style; Scroggins
was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Turner was much applauded in this
round for his manly conduct. In a short
close he let Scroggins down without a blow,
throwing up his hands and walking away.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—This was a grand round, and Scroggins
never displayed anything like such a
knowledge of the pugilistic art in any of his
previous contests. He stopped with considerable
skill, and reciprocal fighting occurred.
Scroggins got rather impetuous, and threw
his blows away; and Turner was also incorrect
in some of his distances. The latter
again hit up at his head, but without effect.
Scroggins went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Considerable execution was done.
Scroggins planted two good hits upon his
opponent’s nob, but Turner returned upon
him so hard and fast that Scroggins turned
round rather confusedly. He, however,
rallied with great spirit till he slipped down.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Well contested and both down, but
Scroggins undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Turner commenced by planting a
successful blow on the head of Scroggins;
but the latter returned in a spirited manner,
and hit, hit, and hit again, till Turner went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Some sharp blows occurred between
the combatants in this round. Scroggins
made a hit over the left eye of Turner, and
he also touched his body; but Turner sent
his adversary down.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—After some sparring, Turner put
down his hands and rubbed them against
his body. Some blows were exchanged.
In struggling to obtain the throw, Turner
neatly tripped up his antagonist.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—The hands of Turner were covered
with the claret of his opponent. In closing,
Scroggins was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Some good hits were exchanged, but
materially in favour of Turner, who planted
four blows in succession, without having any
return, but he (Turner) went down rather
weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Scroggins planted a sharp blow on
the side of Turner’s head, when he dropped
down on one knee, but instantly rose again
and went on his second’s knee.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—Good exchanges. In closing, Turner
was down, and Scroggins fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—On setting-to Turner sighed loudly,
as if in want of wind, and, after some little
sparring, he dropped his hands, as did also
his opponent. Scroggins let several opportunities
slip of going in, and when he did it
was more of the “forlorn hope” sort of
attack, than from the cool judgment of the
tactician.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—The little hero went in with much
resolution, and ultimately sent down Turner
upon his latter end.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—On coming to the scratch Turner displayed
considerable weakness; his knees
trembled violently. In the course of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>round Turner turned from his antagonist,
but Scroggins ultimately went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—Some sparring occurred, and Turner
put down his hands; after this the men
fought their way into a close. They broke
away and closed again, and dealt out to each
other some heavy blows, and Turner received
so severely on his kidneys, that he appeared
to go down from weakness.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—One hour and three minutes had now
elapsed, and Scroggins appeared to stand
the firmest on his legs; but the betting did
not change in his favour. The position of
Turner rendered him so formidable that it
was dangerous to attack him. Scroggins
displayed some of his old antics, and in going
in slipped down from a slight hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—Some blows were exchanged, and
Turner went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—Scroggins even now appeared well
upon his legs, and he followed Turner all
round the ring, and, in closing, Turner was
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—Scroggins felt determined to win if
possible. Turner was hit away from his intention
of going in. It was a good round,
and both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—Notwithstanding Scroggins showed
himself off in good style, the chance was
completely against him. He went down
from a slight hit. Turner in general finished
most of the rounds decidedly in his favour.</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—Scroggins went down from a severe
hit in the body.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—This was a good round. Scroggins
followed his opponent in a desperate manner
all over the ring, and Turner went down
from a slip or a slight hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>34.—The chancery suit was fast coming on
Scroggins, and his nob was completely at the
service of his opponent. The little hardy
hero nevertheless contended for victory till
he fell in an exhausted state.</p>

<p class='c022'>35.—If Scroggins was not satisfied with
the superiority of his opponent, the spectators
had long previous to this period been
convinced that he had no chance of winning.
He went down from a slight hit almost
upon setting-to.</p>

<p class='c022'>36.—Turner sent down Scroggins in a
twinkling, and his legs doubled up.</p>

<p class='c022'>37.—The head of Scroggins was in a terrible
state; but, notwithstanding, he stood
at the scratch in a more firm state than
might have been expected. He was shortly
hit down, and the general cry was, “Take
him away.”</p>

<p class='c022'>38.—The desperation of Scroggins was
not quite exhausted, and he endeavoured to
contend up to the last moment. He was
so weak that he went down from a mere
touch.</p>

<p class='c022'>39 and last.—His friends were now perfectly
satisfied that Scroggins had done
everything that a brave man could attempt.
The idea of losing seemed terrible to his
feelings, and he again endeavoured to meet
his opponent. On setting-to the punishment
of his adversary was so severe that he
turned, in a confused state, and fell forward
upon the ropes. Turner patted him upon
the back, implying, “you are a brave
fellow.” The battle was now at an end.
Scroggins could not come again, and Turner
immediately went up to him and shook him
by the hand before he quitted the ring. It
lasted one hour and thirty-one minutes and
a half.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Scroggins, from the brave
conduct he displayed in this third battle,
completely removed the insinuations which
were levelled at him respecting his defeat at
Sawbridgeworth, and re-established his character
as a determined game boxer. Though
defeated, he has not been disgraced, but
compelled to yield to superior skill, height,
and length. Turner, from his distinguished
conquests over a hero like Scroggins, who
had gained such an ascendancy, has placed
himself at the top of the tree. It should
also be recollected that he has fought four
prize battles, and experienced eight weeks’
close confinement, added to the agitation of
his mind during his trial, within twelve
months. His qualities are rare and valuable,
and his position, though not showy, is
formidable in the extreme. Cool and collected
in the heat of battle, with game of the
first quality, Turner retired from the ring
with merely a slight mark upon his ear.
He was well seconded by Owen and Painter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Turner’s backers presented him with the whole of the battle-money. He
returned to London the same evening, and appeared among the company at
Belcher’s as if nothing had happened. Scroggins showed himself in town
the next morning; his head exhibited terrible marks of punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turner by this second victory attained high pugilistic eminence, yet he
was literally dragged into milling popularity, by the sovereign contempt
with which his capabilities were treated by Scroggins and not a few of his
admirers: however, Turner wore his “blushing honours” with becoming
moderation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>About this period a boxer, well known in after years to Londoners, young
Cy. Davis, of Bristol, attracted much attention, and he was thought in every
respect an excellent match for Turner. Davis, as we have said, was not
only an object of considerable attraction at Bristol, but had recently given
the Londoners a specimen of his quality. A match was therefore made,
by Tom Belcher, on the part of his fellow townsman, Davis, for 100 guineas
a side; and Turner, from his well-known tried qualities, did not want for
friends to support him upon this occasion. Davis stood so well with the
sporting people that it was even betting, the former for choice. Wallingham
Common, in Surrey, seventeen miles from London, was the spot selected
for this combat to take place, and the torrents of rain which prevailed
for some hours on Friday morning, June 18, 1819, did not in the least
deter the amateurs. Most of the fancy scorned even to sport an umbrella,
and it should seem that the recollection of the anniversary of the battle
of Waterloo gave them fresh vigour. At length all difficulties were at an
end, the rain ceased, the ring appeared in view, and preparation was made
for the combat to commence. Turner threw up his hat first in the ring,
attended by Cribb and Randall, when, after waiting a considerable time,
Davis was loudly called for by the Champion. Some minutes elapsed, when
Davis appeared with Tom Belcher and Harmer, and repeated the token of
defiance. At a quarter before two the men set-to, the colours having been
previously tied to the stakes; the true blue was placed by Randall, and the
original yellow-man (which has ever since the period of the late Jem Belcher,
out of compliment to his pugilistic fame, been denominated “a Belcher”<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c009'><sup>[158]</sup></a>)
was tied over the blue by Tom Belcher. Even betting was about the thing.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Davis looked in fine condition,
and appeared to be able to win it off hand;
his opponent, however, showed better than
was expected. But the contrast was
great. Davis, from his fine and elegant
form, was the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</span></i> of the ring-goers,
while Turner looked more like a weatherbeaten
Greenwich pensioner. It was thought
the gay Bristol Boy would go to work without
ceremony, and nob Turner in style, from
the manner he disposed of Belasco the Jew;
but whether the high fame of Turner had
made any impression upon his feelings, or
the Dutch-Sam-like countenance of his opponent
checked him, it is certain that he
was particularly cautious, and Turner hit
first slightly with his left hand. Long sparring,
and Davis kept retreating. Turner put
in five light hits on the body and head, when
Davis smiled. Another long pause of sparring
occurred, and Randall was seen sitting
on the ropes minutely eyeing the tactics of
both the combatants. Some exchanges took
place; the right cheek of Davis appeared
red, and Turner planted a blow on the body
that sent Davis staggering. He went down.
(Loud shouting. Six to four.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Turner had scarcely planted a hit,
when Davis went down. (Great murmurings,
and “Turner, my boy, you’ll win it
without a scratch.” Two to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Great astonishment was excited at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>conduct of Davis, and he seemed as if afraid
to face his man with any confidence. After
some cautious sparring, Turner made a hit,
but it was so much a question whether it
touched Davis or not, that the umpires advised
his seconds that he should be more
careful in future in his going down, as, if
such conduct was pursued, the battle must
immediately have an end. (Disapprobation
expressed.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Turner made play, and used both
hands with success. Davis smiled, and with
a tremendous right-handed hit on the head
knocked Turner down. This decided the
first knock-down blow; Turner also showed
the first blood. (“Go along, Davis,” from
the Bristolians; “you can do it if you like.
Another such hit, and it will be all right.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Instead of Davis going in to follow up
his success, he again went down from a
slight hit; in fact, it was thought almost
without a blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Turner followed Davis, and planted
some hits. The latter, it should seem, had
no inclination to go in, or he might have
stood upon even terms with his opponent.
He was no novice at fighting; he could also
hit hard and stop well. He, however, again
went down, when the Bristol men appeared
quite angry with him, crying out, “Davis,
what are you at?” (Four to one).</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Davis appeared as if he felt these
reproaches, and went to work in earnest.
“Look, look,” observed several amateurs,
“this chap may win it now, if he will but go
in and fight. He can do something if he
likes.” It was a good round; but Davis was
now really hit down. “Bravo, Turner!”
and “Give him a little one for me.” Also,
“Well done, Davis.”</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Davis positively seemed afraid to hit
home. Turner got away from a flooring
right-handed hit; but the latter was now
the most punished, and bleeding. Davis had
the best of the hitting, and gave Turner a
hard blow on the side of the head. Davis
might have showed himself off in good
style, but it was urged he wanted pluck.
Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Davis went down with a slight hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Notwithstanding the shy fighting of
Davis, he hit Turner on the jaw so tremendously
with his right hand, that he went
down like a shot, and seemed almost in a
state of stupor. “Go it, Davis,” from his
partisans; “that’s the way to mill; you’ll
win.” Turner was quite abroad; another
such a hit, had it been quickly repeated,
must have proved a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quietus</span></i>. This dreadful
hit operated seriously on Turner’s backers.
Long faces were seen in all directions, and
even Randall shook his head, scarcely knowing
what to think of it. Indeed, it was all
but over with Turner. Great applause was
here given to Davis, and the Bristolians
were all as gay as larks.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Davis did not follow up his success.
Some sharp exchanges took place, and
Turner’s face was clareted. Davis turned
round from the hitting, and it was thought
that Turner hit him when he was down.
“Foul, foul,” was cried. “Never mind;
they’re only even,” said a sly old sportsman.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Turner stopped most of his opponent’s
blows, and sent him down. This
almost jaw-breaker waked Turner to the
dangerous intent of his opponent’s right
hand. However singular it may appear, it
might almost be urged, that this blow gave
victory to Turner. He now became down to
it, and stopped it with great judgment.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—This was a good round; and Davis
showed like a boxer till he was hit down. If
he had possessed any sort of fear, it seemed
now removed; and his conduct at this juncture
claimed praise. An excellent judge
exclaimed, “Davis may win it now.” The
Bristol Boy here received a great deal of
applause from various parts of the ring.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—The right hand of Davis was very
dangerous, and he nobbed Turner staggering
away; but the latter, game-cock like, returned
to the attack, and sent Davis down.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—In this round Turner beat Davis to a
complete stand-still. “What’s o’clock now?”
cried Cribb. “It’s all up, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c022'>16 to 19.—Turner stopped with great skill
most of Davis’s blows; but Turner received
a dreadful hit over his right eye, that made
him almost go down from its severity. The
claret flowed again; but Turner, undismayed,
followed his opponent, who again
got down in the quickest manner he could,
seemingly to escape hitting.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—In this round Turner got Davis in a
corner, when Randall said, “Ned, do as I
do; keep that in your eye, my boy, and
you’ll soon fetch him out.” Davis turned
aside from the severity of the hitting, and
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>21, 22.—This was a singular round, from
the following circumstance:—Belcher stooped
down and picked up a piece of paper, and
put it in Davis’s left hand, to keep it close.
Turner thought it was a stone, and said, if
that was the way he was to be used, he
would not fight. Randall rushed in to see
what it was, anxious to do his duty as a
second, and almost tore the paper out of
Belcher’s hand, who had now got hold of it,
openly showing it, that nothing unfair was
meant, and that it had been used merely
for the purpose described. Some words ensued.
The umpires inquired the cause of
the disturbance. Belcher explained. It
caused some little agitation round the ring,
many of the amateurs thinking it was a
bank note, and that a wager had been proposed,
and that staking was attempted as a
sort of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</span></i>, to give Davis time.
The umpires appeared satisfied that nothing
“unfair” had been attempted. This was a
sharp, well-fought, short round, and both
the men went down. Davis had now retrieved
his character in a great degree with
the spectators, who asserted that when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>was at work he did not mind it, but that it
appeared he did not like to begin to hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>23 to 26.—Some good rounds, Davis fighting
better than he had done; but in the
latter he received a body hit that made
quite a dent upon his frame. Turner, in
closing, slung him round like a cat. This
wisty-castor on the body occasioned a complete
revolution, and “bellows to mend”
was the true feature.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—Turner put in a dreadful blow under
the ear of Davis, or rather at the back part
of his head. It occasioned a large gash,
and he went down in a pitiable state.</p>

<p class='c022'>28 and 29.—Good rounds and sharp hitting.
Davis determined to let the amateurs
see that he could fight a bit. Both the eyes
of Davis had now been measured for a suit
of mourning; and, on his forehead, he had
got a lump like an egg. It was evident that
after all he did not want for bottom in regard
to taking.</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—Davis, it was asserted, fell without a
blow, and Turner fell heavily on him.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—This round might be termed the
finisher. Davis was so stupid that he stood
quite still, while Turner hit him down. He
could not lift his hands. Nature had deserted
him—his eyes had lost their fire, and
he was viewed by the amateurs as an object
of pity rather than ill-natured remarks.</p>

<p class='c022'>32 and last.—It is true Davis made his
appearance at the scratch, but he turned
away from the blow and fell down. The
contest was over in forty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—If any observations can be
made a nut-shell might contain them. In a
word, too much praise had been previously
bestowed on the prime qualities said to be
possessed by Davis. Owing to his decisive
fight with Belasco, senior, anticipation was
on tiptoe to behold another pugilist from
Bristol—a soil that had given birth to Big
Ben, Jem and Tom Belcher, the Game
Chicken, Tom Cribb, Gulley, Nicholls, Bob
Watson, etc.; names familiar whenever comparisons
are made respecting the goodness
of a boxer. Davis’s right hand was very
dangerous. From his youth, weight, freshness,
and strength, he ought to have won it.
It was urged by his friends that his going
down so often was owing to a weakness in
his knees—a rheumatic affection, which had
seized him a few days previous to the battle.
It is only common justice to Davis to state
that he was terribly beaten about the head,
and one of his hands, arms, and shoulders
exhibited heavy punishment; more experience,
and another trial, perhaps, may
recover him his lost laurel. It is no new
case that some men are “half beat” before
they enter the ring; and that young soldiers
wink on first smelling powder. It should
also be remembered that only one Randall
and one Turner at present stand upon the
list. The talents of the latter are so well
known that it would be superfluous to state
them. Upon this occasion, however, he
became the offensive instead of the defensive
pugilist. He might have been better in condition
had longer time been allowed him;
at all events, it must be a second Randall to
defeat Turner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such was the opinion of some of the best judges of the time, and it certainly
was not prudent at any rate to match young Cy. against so good a
tactician as Turner for a first trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sporting world now looked forward to a match between Turner and
Martin, more especially as Turner, after his defeat by Randall, had been
challenged by Martin, who had about the same time disposed of the hardy
Scroggins; both men too had succumbed to Randall, and the different styles
of their defeats had been the topic of much critical discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The match was at length made, neither man being loth, at Tom Spring’s
(Tom then kept the Catherine Wheel, Little St. James’s Street, Pall Mall).
Five to four on Turner was the first offer, but these odds were thought too
small. Master Scroggins, who was an original in his way, being present,
submitted the following remarks for the consideration of the amateurs: “He
would not give tuppence for choice—he had tried both the men: Turner was
the awkwardest man alive to get at; but Martin was the hardest hitter.
Two gamer coves never entered the ring, and when either of the men said
‘No,’ the other would be very glad of it.” The opinion of Randall was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>diametrically opposite. He had also entered the lists with Martin and
Turner. Scroggins was defeated by the latter in one hour and twelve
minutes in good style; while, on the contrary, Martin, after a desperate contest,
with Scroggins, of two hours and two minutes, only gained it, as it
were, by the toss up of a halfpenny. Calculations were made accordingly,
and Turner rose to seven to four, with evens offered that the fight lasted
over an hour, and two to one that Turner was not beaten in one hour and a
quarter.</p>

<p class='c007'>This battle took place on Tuesday, October 26, 1819, for 100 guineas
a side, at Wallingham Common, Surrey. Little betting occurred on the day
of fighting, as it was booked to a certainty that Turner must win. The road,
however, on the morning of fighting, exhibited the usual features of fun,
frolic, and disaster. At one o’clock Turner threw his hat within the ropes,
followed by Tom Belcher and Randall; Martin quickly replied, having the
assistance and advice of Tom Cribb and Tom Spring.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On stripping, both combatants
appeared in the highest condition. Martin
was as fine as the human frame could be
trained; true, he looked big, but there was
nothing gross about him; his form, however,
seemed more calculated for a successful pedestrian
than a pugilist, in consequence of
the heavier half of him being from his hips
to his feet. Turner was all that could be
wished; indeed, he was never in such good
trim before, and, excepting the weakness of
his knee, there was not the slightest uneasiness
by his friends as to the result. Much
cautious sparring for an opening occurred
before a blow was struck. Martin kept retreating
a little, but at length he made a
hit, which was stopped cleanly by Turner.
Another pause, when Turner made a slight
hit, and Martin kept getting away. Turner
cool, and on the look-out, with his left hand
felt for the body of his opponent, and, in
returning, Martin threw his blow away.
The latter seemed rather tired with holding
up his hands, and on his looking down to the
ground, the good generalship of Turner was
visible to all the ring, as he immediately let
fly on Martin’s nob. The baker, however,
disengaged himself from a short rally, but
in this spirt one of his ogles got severely
damaged, and the claret was oozing out of
the corner. Martin retreated from the
attacks of his opponent to the corner of the
ring, when some blows were exchanged, and,
on Martin’s going down, he thought he had
been hit improperly, as he exclaimed, “Isn’t
that foul?”</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Turner soon put in a bodier, and repeated
it without any return, but on attempting
it a third time Martin stopped him.
Turner, with much dexterity, put in a severe
facer with his left hand, and also a winder,
but Martin made some of his blows tell,
and, in a severe struggle for the throw, both
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Martin did not attempt to hit first, or
to smash, as was anticipated, but kept retreating
till he was compelled to hit as it
were in his own defence. He again got into
the corner of the ring, pursued by his opponent;
but, unlike the Nonpareil, when in
this perilous situation, he did not appear to
know how to extricate himself, and went
down from a hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—This was a manly round, and Martin
made an exchange of hits, and also endeavoured
to fib Turner. It was a sharp struggle,
and both down, but Turner undermost.
“Well done, Martin;” and the floury coves
took a little courage, and sported a dead
man or two, as they thought upon the
improved suit.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—This round was a most mischievous
one to Martin, and materially reduced his
strength. He received a dreadful jobber
right on his nose, and some other ugly hits,
and, after a severe struggle, in going down
Turner fell heavily upon him.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Martin came up to the scratch distressed,
but he commenced fighting, and hit
Turner on the nob. The latter received it
with the most perfect <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>, and soon
after put in a throttler that almost deprived
the baker of breath. Turner followed it up
by a bodier. Martin tried to make a return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>but without effect; and, in getting away
from his opponent, he staggered and fell
from weakness.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Martin made a good stop, but he soon
went down quite exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The baker, with much courage, endeavoured
to plant two good hits, but Turner
stopped them with scientific excellence.
Martin was very weak, and kept getting
away, till he got a facer that sent him down,
and his head rolled about like a top. Twenty
to five was now offered.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Martin came staggering to the scratch,
and it was not long before he again found
himself upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—The fine stopping of Turner put all
the well-meant efforts of Martin at defiance.
This was a good round, and Martin fought
manfully till he was fibbed down by Turner,
who walked away.</p>

<p class='c022'>11 to 15.—Martin was getting better in
the last round, and threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Turner not only had the best of the
hitting, but fell heavily upon Martin.</p>

<p class='c022'>17 and 18.—Turner put in a severe blow
on the chest, and, in struggling for the
throw, he slung Martin round and round till
he went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—The science of Turner, in stopping
nearly all the blows of Martin, convinced
the good judges that, without an accident,
he was winning cleverly. Martin, however,
got Turner down in this round, and it was a
bad fall for the latter.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—This was a sharp round, but nothing
could keep Martin from retreating to the
corner of the ring. Randall ordered the
bottles to be moved, and both of them went
down from a sharp struggle.</p>

<p class='c022'>21 to 23.—It is true Martin was much
better, but he could not take the lead.
Turner, however, showed symptoms of weakness,
and a little brandy was given him to
recruit. Both down in all these rounds.</p>

<p class='c022'>24 to 26.—The friends of Martin thought
his chance improved; and in the last round,
in throwing Turner, the bad knee of the
latter narrowly escaped the post as his leg
came in contact with it.</p>

<p class='c022'>27 to 30.—Turner still fought cautiously,
put in a good one now and then, reducing the
strength of his opponent with ease to himself,
and certainty as to the event. The majority
of these rounds were in favour of Turner.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—Martin put in a sharp nobber, and
also a body blow, and had altogether the
best of this round, till they both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—The baker felt elated with his success,
and went sharply to work, and put in another
heavy facer, and also some hits, till Turner
went down weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—Turner let fly on setting-to, and a
dreadful blow under the ear seemed almost
to deprive Martin of his recollection. He,
however, got away, and, upon endeavouring
to make a stand, he fell down exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>34.—This round might be termed the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quietus</span></i>. Some blows were exchanged, when
Turner hooked his opponent round the neck
and hit him in the body, ditto, ditto, ditto,
ditto, and ditto, and in struggling for the
throw, while going down, Martin received
another heavy body blow. “Well done,
Turner,” and loud applause.</p>

<p class='c022'>35.—The excellence displayed by Turner
was of the highest order. He was never
seen to such advantage before; and Angelo,
in the best of his days, could not have shown
greater skill in fencing than Turner did in
parrying off the attacks of his opponent.
The knee of Turner failed him in this round,
and he slipped down from a slight hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>36.—This was a good round, and the hitting
was sharp on both sides. Martin exerted
his last effort, and put in some heavy blows,
till Turner slipped and went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>37.—It was all up with Martin, and he
was so exhausted, that, in endeavouring to
get away from the punishment of Turner, it
was said he fell without a blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>38.—This was a similar round, when Turner
said, “Jack, if I am to be beat, stand up
and win it like a man.” Martin was in such
a state of stupor as not to be able to reply.</p>

<p class='c022'>39.—Martin was here so dead-beat that
he again fell down without a blow. Some
murmurings occurred, when the umpire
said, “Martin, recollect this is to be a stand-up
fight.”</p>

<p class='c022'>40 and last.—Martin endeavoured to put
in a blow, and went down from a slight hit.
On the baker being put upon his second’s
knee, and time called, Cribb said, “I believe
we may say it’s all over.”</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Martin was very much
punished about the throat, but particularly
about his chest and body, yet scarcely any
claret was spilt on this occasion. It was
urged by some persons present that it was
not a good fight, and that Martin did not
show any pretensions to pugilism. It should,
however, be recollected that Martin was opposed
to one of the first boxers of the day,
and that all his efforts were stopped by the
superior skill of his opponent. Turner also
exhibited great improvement, and fought
well with his right hand. He showed himself
a complete general, for although he lost
the toss, he seldom failed by his manœuvres
in the round to place his adversary with his
face to the sun. The coolness of Turner
was also greatly in his favour; he can receive
without being put out of his course. The
Nonpareil has now left the Ring, but it may
be said that Turner is also a Nonpareil. It
was urged that could Turner have trusted to
his knee, the fight would have been over in
fifty minutes instead of one hour and seven
(the time it lasted). He retired from the
contest almost without a scratch upon his
face, and it should be taken into the scale of
calculation that Martin is not to be got at
so very easy, as he is tall, and leans very
backward on setting-to. Turner was considerably
under eleven stone, and Martin
eleven stone four pounds.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>Martin, it appears, was by no means satisfied with his defeat at the hands
of Turner, but he resolved to have a little more experience in the prize ring
before he essayed another match with that clever boxer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Belcher, when <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bacchi plenis</span></i>, at Cy. Davis’s opening dinner at the
Bear and Ragged Staff, Smithfield, Wednesday, August 9, 1820, made a
foolish challenge to Turner, and also Randall, to fight each for £500 a side,
and articles were drawn and a deposit made. On the following Saturday,
the fumes of the wine having evaporated, all parties shook hands in friendship,
Belcher acknowledging it was the liquor that was speaking, and the
affair, exaggerated into importance by “the historian” ended in smoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the interim Martin had defeated, as we have already noted in the Life
of <span class='sc'>Randall</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 351, Josh. Hudson, Cabbage, Phil. Simpson, and Dav.
Hudson, and now challenged Turner to a second contest for £100 a-side.
Ned could not in honour refuse, and on the 5th of June, 1821, our hero was
defeated, as will be seen at length in the Life of <span class='sc'>Martin</span> in the next chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The success of Martin brought forward another old opponent. Cy. Davis,
having beaten J. Bushell at Moulsey, and feeling mortified at his defeat by
Turner, addressed a letter to Turner, and shortly after they met. Six to
four was betted upon Davis, and the result justified the odds. The gallant
Ned was out of condition, and fell before the strength and freshness of his
youthful antagonist. See <span class='sc'>Cy. Davis</span>, in Appendix to this Period.</p>

<p class='c007'>A new candidate for fistic honours, Peace Inglis, having beaten one
Hamilton, a waterman, at Moulsey (in 1822), then Deaf Davis at Harpenden
(in February, 1823), and lastly George Curtis, brother of the Pet (in August
of the same year), was matched against Turner for £100. The battle took
place, April 20, 1824, and the brave Ned again succumbed to youth and
stamina.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the curtain finally falls upon the pugilistic career of Turner, we
have a closing scene of triumph to redeem by a bright ray his setting sun.
Challenged by Inglis, Ned at first declined to fight for less than £200, but
was at last prevailed upon to make it £100, and Tuesday, November 9,
1824, being appointed, the former antagonists met at Colnbrook. The
counter attraction of Lord Mayor’s Day, for it was then a pageant and a
general city festival, thinned the road a little; but the regular ring-goers
were there, and the old fanciers evinced high interest that the once glorious
veteran should repair his recent reverses. His veteran daddy, “the sage of
the East” (Tom Owen), who had been his companion for the last fortnight,
keeping a watchful eye over Turner’s training at Walton, unfortunately met
with an accident, and sprained his ankle, which prevented him from filling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>the position of second to his “darling boy.” Inglis looked well, and was
confident of success, and, from his known bravery, was a fancy article,
although the odds were against him. Turner first showed, attended by Tom
Shelton and Harry Holt, and threw his hat into the ring. Inglis soon
followed, but his castor (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">absit omen</span></i>) fell outside of the ropes. Jem Ward
and Ned Neale were his seconds. A brave fight was anticipated.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On peeling, the ould one looked
like a new man. The renovating air of the
Welsh mountains appeared to have had the
desired effect upon the frame of Turner.
He looked steadily at his opponent, and
made himself up to do mischief, but Inglis
avoided close quarters. After some little
dodging, an exchange of blows, but nothing
the matter. Inglis got out of the corner
well, but, in the middle of the ring, he
napped a hit, which gave him the staggers.
“Beautiful!” exclaimed the boys from Bermondsey.
Turner, on going in, received a
heavy right-handed blow between the ogles
that made him wink again, filling his eyes
with water, but no tears! This blow rather
alarmed his backers, and the face of Jack
Randall betrayed a serious aspect for the
safety of his friend. Turner missed an upper-cut
blow, which, in all probability, might
have shortened the battle. Inglis was very
quick upon his legs, but, although he made
several motions to do summut, the position
of Turner was so difficult that he could not
get at him. Turner at length planted a
nobber, and Inglis fell on one knee. (Huzzas,
roars, and clapping of hands, expressive of
the joy felt by the Bermondseyites at the
success of Turner.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Turner was determined not to give
another chance away; and the hint, “He’s
coming with his right hand,” roared out by
the eloquent Holt, kept Turner awake.
Inglis bobbed his head once or twice; and it
was lucky he did so, as a chancery slice was
in readiness for him. Some heavy blows
were exchanged, with this difference, Turner
stopped them, while Inglis received. The
latter got a severe nose-ender, which not
only uncorked the claret, but left a stupefying
quality behind it. “Bravo, Turner; the
ould one is a little bit stronger than he was
last time.” In a scuffle, two little drops of
blood appeared on Turner’s cheek. In closing,
both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—This was a short round. Ned was the
hero of the tale at this early part of the
fight; but “hopes and fears” were expressed
as to his strength. “If he can but last,” said
a knowing one, “it is as safe as the Bank.”
The stops of Turner were truly excellent;
but Inglis bored him to the ropes, and fell
on him.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Inglis got away from several rum
ones; but he never took the lead to do any
mischief. Turner planted in succession two
heavy hits—stupefiers; Inglis never flinched.
Turner got Inglis down, amidst most uproarious
thunders of applause.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—This round added considerably to the
odds in favour of Turner. After two or
three movements of no effect, the ould one
caught Inglis with a cutting-up, or rather a
cutting-down, blow, and Inglis was floored.
An artillery salute, and seven to four offered
freely.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Inglis again napped a staggering blow,
and twirled round in a confused state; nevertheless,
he recovered himself, and fought
like a good one, till both went down, Inglis
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—The goodness of Inglis was never
doubted, but there was nothing like winning
about his exertions, provided Turner’s
strength did not leave him. Inglis napped
it on the mouth, succeeded by two severe
facers. This was a long round. Inglis
planted a slight body blow, but he received
three blows for one, till Ned slipped accidentally
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The young one was piping a little, and
the ould one was none the worse for a pause.
Sparring for wind. In a struggle both went
down, but the feather-bed maker was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—This round booked it almost to a certainty
for Bermondsey. Two facers once
more put Inglis’s nob into chancery. The
young one, however, as good as gold, not
only stopped, but countered well. The nose
of Inglis, however, was at the service of
Ned, and the claret followed as pure as any
sample from the bins of Charley Wright, of
the Haymarket. The eyes of Inglis lost
their fire, and his countenance bore the
marks of his mind being abroad. The latter
hit anyhow, till he was floored by a nobber.
(Cheers, noise, and applause. Two and three
to one offered on Turner.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—The chancery suit had performed the
task for Ned, and Inglis was done almost
brown. He, however, endeavoured to rally,
but another cutting-up hit, added to his,
already shakey state, produced extreme grogginess.
His game was so good that he stood
up like bricks, till a hit, almost severe enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>to have knocked a stone out of a wall, again
floored the brave but unfortunate feather-bed
maker. (“Take him away, he has no
chance!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—It was evident to every spectator that
Inglis could not win. He staggered like a
drunken man; but his goodness enabled him
to show fight, and he made blows with the
most determined spirit. The ould one again
caught him with an upper-cut, and, as he
went down, Ned might have added more
punishment, but he nobly disdained taking
an advantage, held up his hands, and walked
away, amidst loud shouts of approbation.
(“Bravo! Ned; that is like an Englishman.”
“True courage is always backed by feeling
and generosity—first the lion and then the
lamb,” said a cove in a rusty black suit,
something like a schoolmaster. “Never
mind,” said one of the Partiality Club, “it
is good doctrine, come from whom it may.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Short, but terribly severe. Inglis
was floored <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans ceremonie</span></i> by Turner.
(“Take the brave fellow away.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—When time was called, his seconds
bustled him up; but Inglis was in a doldrum
till they shook him, and, on roaring out in
his ear, “Ned’s coming,” he opened his eyes
wildly, and, as if by instinct, prepared himself
to fight. He rushed towards his opponent,
but Turner sent him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—“His youth will bring him round,”
observed a few of his friends. “Not this
fight,” said a costermonger; “he’s done
brown twice over.” Inglis again down. A
hat was thrown up—</p>

<p class='c022'>15th and last.—But he came again to the
scratch. Inglis staggered about for a second
or two, when he fell stupefied, Turner merely
looking at him. It was over in forty-six
minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Science must win, if supported
by moderate strength; science will
win if a man is out of condition—that is to
say, science will get a man out of trouble;
it enables a boxer to wait for his man, time
him, meet his opponent, bring him down to
his weight, and ultimately prove the conqueror.
It is not necessary for a long yarn
to describe the beauties of the “ould one” in
the ring; suffice it to observe, Ned is a
master of the art; his stops were interesting
to the spectator; his hits were decisive, and
he finished off his man like a first-rate
artist. Excepting a tremendous right-handed
lunge which Ned received between
his eyes in the first round, all the other hits
did little execution. The method adopted
by Turner to lead his opponent into trouble,
and then punishing him for his temerity,
evinced skill and tactics of the highest order
of milling. Inglis proved himself a game
man in every point of view; but, valuable a
quality as endurance must always be considered
in boxing, it is of little use when a
man’s head gets into chancery. Inglis was
beaten to a stand-still, and ought to have
been taken away three rounds before the
fight was over. Inglis was a brave, worthy,
honest, well-conditioned creature. Turner
must have won the battle much sooner had
not one of the small bones in his left hand
been broken in the early part of the fight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Ned was highly pleased to take leave of the prize ring in the character
of a winner, and dined with his friends at Bill Moss’s, the Crown, in
the Borough, on Monday, November 15, 1824. He was surrounded by
some capital sporting patrons. On his health being drunk, he said, “It
was very likely that he should not fight any more; but if he did alter his
mind, he would always behave like a man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Turner gradually began to decline in health: he became lame, and, labouring
under the effects of an asthma, announced his farewell benefit to take
place in April, 1826. His last appearance on any public occasion, was at
Hudson’s dinner, on Thursday, March 31, 1826.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out of respect to an old favourite in the prize ring, the amateurs mustered
strongly at the Tennis Court, on Tuesday, April 18, but it was not made
known to the visitors that poor Ned had departed this life on Monday (the
preceding day) at two minutes before five in the afternoon. The sets-to,
generally, were well contested.</p>

<p class='c007'>Randall and Scroggins mounted the stage, and having made their bows,
the former came forward, and spoke as follows:—“Gentlemen, I am requested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>by the friends of poor Turner to come forward and express their
thanks in his behalf, for the kind and liberal manner in which you have this
day manifested an interest in his fate. Gentlemen, Ned and I have been
opponents in the ring, but we have always been friends in private, and no
man feels more for his situation than I do. That we shall be able to see him
here at any future time, I think is more than doubtful; but let us hope we
may all see him hereafter” (loud applause). Randall appeared much affected.
Jack Scroggins followed. “Gemmen,” said he, “Ned was always a gentlemanly
sort of a man—he is now gone to his long home, and I hope God will
forgive him, as well as everybody else. Let us all live while we can, and
when we can’t live no longer, why, I suppose we must die; and I don’t see
why a fighting man shouldn’t see eternity as well as anybody else.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Turner’s remains were removed on Sunday, April 23, 1826, between the
hours of one and two, from the house of his cousin, Mr. Baxter, hat maker,
in East Smithfield, and deposited in a deep grave in Aldgate Churchyard.
The funeral was of the most respectable description. The hearse was followed
by two mourning coaches. In the first coach were Mr. Turner (father of the
deceased), Mr. Baxter (a cousin of Ned’s), Mr. Leslie, Tom Owen, and Pierce
Egan. In the second mourning coach were Tom Cribb, Josh. Hudson, Jack
Randall, Harry Holt, Harry Harmer, and Mr. Price Morris.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From an early hour in the morning,” says the report, “the house of Mr.
Baxter was surrounded by numbers of persons anxious to pay respect to the
remains of a man who once stood so high amongst the admirers of the art of
self-defence. The church and churchyard also were crowded. We noticed
many of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps pugilistique</span></i>. Scroggins, for the feeling and respect he paid
to the deceased, deserves the highest praise. Forgetting all former differences;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>nay, more, following the side of the hearse, and dropping a tear over
the grave of the man who had proved his conqueror, speaks a volume in his
favour, as a generous-minded English boxer. Every person present appeared
sorry for the loss of Turner. In all his battles he behaved like an honest,
honourable man; in fact, throughout his life he was never known to have
committed a dishonourable action—his conduct was always upon the square.
His last moments were marked by resignation and Christian-like behaviour;
and he expired without a sigh in the arms of his cousin, Mr. Baxter.
Turner was in the thirty-fourth year of his age.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The reporter adds, “Turner was a most difficult boxer to be got at; standing
with his right leg first, he proved at all times a truly awkward and dangerous
customer. In a set-to with the gloves with Tom Spring, at a benefit
in the city of Norwich, previous to the fight between Painter and Oliver, the
science of Ned Turner was so much admired, and his blows were so effective,
as to produce thunders of applause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In point of true courage, Turner was never excelled in or out of the ring.
He was a most modest, unassuming fellow, and, notwithstanding his intercourse
with various grades of society, he was a ‘bashful’ man. In company
he was cheerful and good-natured, always anxious to serve his brethren in
the prize ring, and throughout the sporting world he was as much respected
for his civility as his high courage.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'>JACK MARTIN (THE “MASTER OF THE ROLLS”)—1813‒1828.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c009'><sup>[160]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c013'>Jack Martin, on whom the ring reporters conferred the punning title of
“Master of the Rolls,” from his calling as a baker, was born on the 10th of
July, 1796, near Kennington Church.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boxiana” contains the usual preliminary narrative of a “big coal-heaver,”
“a sheriff’s officer, a well-known good man,” “a butcher,” etc.,
whom Martin disposed of while “a boy.” We shall pass these, and come to
young Doughey’s first reported battle, which was with Tom Oliver’s brother
George, at Ilford, in Essex, for 20 guineas, on Thursday, July 18, 1816, in a
twenty-four feet ring, after the fight between Ford and Harry Lancaster.
George Oliver was seconded by his brother Tom and Jack Clark, Martin by
Harry Harmer and Bill Richmond. Five to four on Oliver.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The attitude of Martin was free
and good; it spoke more of the sparring
school than that of his opponent, which was
by no means that of a scientific boxer. Martin
immediately went to work and nobbed
his opponent without ceremony, till they got
into a close, when, after hugging and pummelling
each other for a few seconds, they
broke away, and some hits were exchanged
at arm’s length. They again closed and a
violent struggle took place against the ropes,
when they both went down. This round
occupied one minute and a half.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Both full of activity, but the flurried
manner of Oliver was evident to every one,
and his fists crossed each other with the
celerity of a smoke-jack. He presented
no security from attack, and his mug got
pinked in style. In closing, they both went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The Master of the Rolls put in two
severe facers, and beat his opponent down
against the stakes. On commencing this
round Oliver tried to trip up his adversary,
but his brother told him it was wrong.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Oliver, although brought into the ring
by his brother, really seemed to have no
notion of fighting. He hit at random, and
did but little execution. The baker again
milled his face, and ultimately threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—This was a dreadful round for punishment.
In closing, some heavy hits passed
between them, and they broke away. The
blood was running down Oliver’s face; notwithstanding,
he fought his way into a desperate
rally, in which his nob received a
couple of desperate blows. In closing, they
both got suspended on the ropes, and a violent
struggle took place before they went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>6.—Some sharp milling; and, in closing,
both fell out of the ring.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Oliver displayed no science whatever;
his chief aim seemed to be struggling
with his opponent; but even in closing he
failed, as Martin generally brought Oliver
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The right hand of Martin again
punished Oliver’s nob, and the claret flowed
in abundance. In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—The hugging system again prevailed.
Both down, but Oliver fell completely over
the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Martin went in with great spirit and
bored his adversary to the ropes. In closing,
both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Oliver appeared rather distressed, and
came slowly up to the mark. The right
hand of the baker was again at work, and
Oliver’s mug was getting fast out of shape.
Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—In this round Martin showed he possessed
scientific knowledge, had completely
the best of it, and sent his opponent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Oliver seemed anxious to do something,
and went sharply up to his man, when
they closed. In struggling they broke away,
and several heavy blows were exchanged.
They again closed, and both went down,
Oliver bleeding profusely.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—The movements, in general, of Martin
were scientific, but they were soon lost sight
of in the overpowering close of Oliver, who
always endeavoured to force his adversary to
the ropes, and tire him out by struggling.
Both down, and their backs and loins were
much marked by their suspension on the
ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Martin, upon setting-to, nobbed
Oliver with effect, when they again closed,
and both fell out of the ring. Oliver required
the assistance of his second to get him off
the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—The strength of Oliver was leaving
him fast, and in this round he got dreadfully
punished. The baker hit him in every
direction; Oliver was thrown completely
over the ropes. (Seven to four upon Martin.)</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—No chance for Oliver, except closing;
he caught hold of Martin, and both went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—More hugging, and both on the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—It was all up with Oliver; the fight
was taken out of him, and he had not
strength to close with his opponent. In
fact, he only stood up as a mark for punishment;
and the baker put in some severe hits
till Oliver dropped like a log.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Oliver could scarcely stagger to the
scratch. He immediately went down from a
punishing hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>21 and last.—Oliver had had quite enough
of milling, and turned away from his adversary
to avoid. The baker lost no time, he
saw victory was certain, and with two hits
completely finished his opponent. Twenty-nine
minutes had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Oliver, as a scientific boxer,
had no resemblance to his brother except
his name. In fact, he was a complete
novice in every sense of the word; relied
entirely upon main strength for victory,
and pulled and hauled his opponent about.
It was widely different on the part of Martin:
he exhibited those promising traits of
science that appear only to want practice
to improve, and which, at some future
period, may develop themselves in a more
conspicuous manner. Martin is in height
about five feet nine inches, and eleven stone
in weight. He is extremely active, and
possesses a decisive mode of hitting.</p>

<p class='c013'>This promising <em>debut</em> inspirited Martin to issue a challenge at eleven stone,
but two years elapsed before he got suited with a customer in “Paddington
Johnson,” for 50 guineas a side. The battle came off at Coventry Farm, the
Hale, Middlesex, on Tuesday, September 15, 1818. Johnson was well
known to the ring, from his conquests over Roe, Harry Lancaster, and Purcell,
also as a right-handed hitter, and an acknowledged game man. Martin was
better known for theory than in practice, and more as a sparrer than a pugilist.
In consequence Johnson was the favourite, six to four. The latter
first showed, and threw his hat in the ring, and Martin soon followed the
example in a very modest unassuming manner. Johnson was seconded by
the veteran Joe Ward and Paddington Jones; Martin was waited upon by
Ben Burn and Spring. The Baker, it seems, disdained the ordinary mode of
milling in drawers, and appeared in a loose fashionable pair of white trowsers.
This change was generally considered an improvement. Five minutes to one
o’clock the men set-to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On stripping, Johnson appeared
the rounder and bigger man. His face was
full of colour, and he looked well; but the
judges of training thought him too bulky;
however, he was considered generally to be
in excellent condition. Martin, on the contrary,
looked pale; but in other respects his
canvass was as sleek and as smooth as a
thorough-bred greyhound. Upon the combatants
taking their attitudes, Johnson exhibited
the highest confidence, and made a
sort of springing run to mill his opponent in
his usual rushing style; but the leariness of
Martin stopped him by a slight muzzler.
The latter almost instantly surprised Johnson
with another header, that not only operated
on his vision, but tapped the claret.
Johnson endeavoured to feel for the alimentary
reservoir of the baker, when a close
took place, and Johnson tried to fib his
crusty foe without effect. In struggling,
Martin appeared the stronger man, as Johnson
was undermost on the ground. The
“dead men” smiled at this favourable commencement
of their hero, but the six to four
blades did not half like it.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Martin seemed perfectly prepared for
his enemy, with the skill and caution of an
experienced tactician. He planted his hits
upon the nob of Johnson with as much <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang
froid</span></i> as if he had been aiming at a sack of
flour. The “Paddington boy,” rather enraged
at this sort of treatment, tried again to rush
into doughey’s victualling office, but the
latter got away, and in return mugged him
so severely, that Johnson went half round
in a singular style, and in a struggle Johnson
was again undermost. The odds were
now completely turned, and the Baker was
the favourite; in some parts of the ring two
to one.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The handywork of Martin upon his
opponent’s title-page was now apparent;
one of his peepers was already in mourning,
and the other had been taken measure of for
black drapery, added to the claret trickling
down his face. The rushing of Johnson was
also stayed, and some long sparring occurred
before any work was attempted; the latter,
however, tried to body the Baker, but the
science of Martin prevented any serious
effect; and in return he gave him one, two,
severely. In closing, Johnson also napt
upon the fibbing system, and, in struggling
to obtain the throw, he was compelled to
yield to the superior strength of the “Master
of the Rolls.” The batch lads were roaring
with delight, and “Bravo!” was echoed
through the fraternity at the talent displayed
by Martin.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—This round decided the fight; the execution
done by Martin positively made the
odds the monument to a bodkin. On setting-to,
the Baker gave his opponent three staggering
facers. Johnson turned round from
the force of the last hit, but his game never
deserted him, and he returned to the attack
like a trump. Johnson’s right hand told
slightly on Martin’s side, but as to anything
like punishment he could not administer
any. It was a long round, occupying five
minutes, without any closing, during which
time, notwithstanding Martin hit frequently
short, he planted twelve facers with ease and
dexterity. Martin followed Johnson so
closely up, that he was at length hit down
on his knees, and measured his length on the
grass quite exhausted. The “dead men”
were all upon the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</span></i>, and, in the pride
of the moment, offered to the hitherto confident
Westminster and Paddington costermongers,
a peck loaf to a halfpenny roll;
but the donkey proprietors shied it.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Johnson’s nob now exhibited a Fuseli
aspect—it was so changed, as to call forth
the observation of “an old friend with a
new face.” Martin went to work with both
hands so quickly, that his opponent’s sensitive
plant rolled about like a humming-top,
and he fell out of the ring. (Great shouting,
and any odds offered.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Johnson was quite abroad, gasping for
breath. He could not get at Martin; but
was compelled to act as receiver-general
till he could no longer stand to take it.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Johnson only came up to take, and
one, two, and three, were put in so terribly
upon his already damaged mug, that he
reeled in all directions. He was also
punished round the ring, and Martin lost his
balance in hitting Johnson as they were
both going down. Loud cries of “Foul”
and “Fair” took place; but this attempt to
create a diversion would not do, and the
fight proceeded.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Martin missed several hits, although
he nobbed his opponent grievously; Johnson,
from a desperate effort, got Martin
down. Hats were now thrown up, “Well
done, Johnson; now you’ll see him go to
work,” etc., and loud applause followed.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—This was but a momentary triumph
for poor Johnson, who commenced the round
with much spirit, and fought away like a
truly game man. Martin, however, cautious
and collected, put in one, two, straight
shoulder-hits upon Johnson’s distracted
upper works that must have operated stunningly
upon his senses. The Baker broke
away from his opponent with surprising
agility, and ultimately gave Johnson so tremendous
a nobber, that he went down as if
shot, and rolled over upon his face. (Twenty
to one, but scarcely any person would take
it.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—It was all up with Johnson, and he
again received so much nobbing that he laid
himself down.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>11.—Martin, eager to finish the contest,
gave Johnson no chance of recovering from
his puzzled state, but ran in to him, and
floored him <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans ceremonie</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Johnson, who had hitherto been
cheered with the smiles of conquest, still
endeavoured to protract the contest. Martin
again nobbed him with scarcely any return,
and Johnson went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>13th and last.—It was expected Johnson
would not again show at the scratch; but it
appeared that while he could lift up his
hands he was determined to fight. He was,
however, soon milled down; and, upon being
placed upon his second’s knee, it was communicated
to Martin he had no longer any
foe to contend against. Johnson, with true
manliness, shook hands with Martin; when
he became so exhausted that he was carried
out of the ring, and put into a coach.
Martin immediately ran and got into a postchaise,
and drove off the ground. It was
over in thirty minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—No pugilist ever left the ring
less punished than did Martin; and, except
a trifling mark on the side of his head, there
was not the slightest trace that he had been
engaged in a prize contest. He won the
battle with ease, science, and execution,
equal to any boxer upon the list. Johnson
had not a shadow of chance with Martin;
and, however the admirers of the former
may urge that his constitution was broken
up, yet in his prime he could never have defeated
the baker. It is two to one against
any puddling fighter, however game he may
be, when opposed to a real scientific two-handed
boxer. To judge impartially of
Martin’s talents, it was thought that he
must be tried with a real good one, where
science is opposed to skill, wariness contrasted
with caution, and when in the pinch
of the game bottom is exhibited to make up
the grand climax. The attitude of Martin,
in one or two instances, resembled Spring’s;
he leant his body too much upon his loins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The above contest and two others proved a rare day’s sport, and, notwithstanding
the torrents of rain, which never ceased during the fights, the
amateurs proved themselves game as pebbles, and kept their ground with
indifference. Some funning took place amongst a few swell pedestrians, who
were induced to marrow bone it, in consequence of the fineness of the
weather, chaffing that they were transformed into clodhoppers from the
heavy pieces of clay clinging to their feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Martin, it appears, could not get any immediate employment for his
fists, he felt determined that his legs should not stand idle, and therefore
backed himself in a pugilistic foot race, a few days after this battle. On
Monday, September 28, 1818, in Hyde Park, at eight o’clock in the morning,
a muster of amateurs assembled to witness a race for a rump and a dozen,
between Spring, Ben Burn, Martin, and a novice. The distance 200 yards.
The latter declined previous to the time of starting. The race was spiritedly
contested, but Martin took the lead, kept it, and came in first. Spring was
second at the winning post; Ben Burn, though last, ran in good style, and
was but a little distance behind Spring. The 200 yards were run in 25
seconds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Master of the Rolls having now made progress towards celebrity in the
prize ring, was, from the following unexpected circumstance, again brought
before the judgment of the amateurs, in opposition to a boxer who, notwithstanding
his defeats by Turner, still stood high in the opinion of the
fancy in general. At Parish’s benefit, held in a large room at the Coal
Exchange, near Billingsgate, the principal feature of the evening was the
bout between Martin and Scroggins, which was interesting as a test of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>the capabilities of the crusty hero. The length and height of the Master of
the Rolls over his opponent was evident to all. Scroggins in this combat
proved himself a tragi-comic performer of talent; and, under the mask of fun,
he not only produced roars of laughter, made his audience frequently look
serious, and worked upon his adversary’s feelings, but concluded by exciting
their utmost astonishment. In short, if the conqueror of Johnson did not
gammon it, and it was a real thing, the fact then is that neither the length
nor the science of the Baker could prevent the boring qualities of Scroggins
from doing heavy execution (so well known and felt by all his opponents,
except Turner), and ultimately sending Martin down. Upon Scroggins
quitting the room, with the best of the bout, “another round” was loudly
called for by the partizans of the Baker. Scroggins immediately returned,
went to work again without delay, and, as the grand climax, hit Martin
down with the celerity of a shot, then turning round, said, with much
naiveté, “Gentlemen, are you now satisfied?” “Quite, quite,” were the
replies; and the little tar left the room overwhelmed with peals of applause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several amateurs were so decidedly in favour of Scroggins, that a deposit
was immediately put down to make it a match for £100 a side, and a purse
of £50 for the winner. But in consequence of the amateurs withdrawing
the purse of £50, this match was off, and the friends of Scroggins forfeited
their deposit of £5. However, a few days afterwards a new match was
made, and the following articles agreed to:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The odds were immediately five to four on Martin, and in some instances
higher.</p>

<p class='c007'>This mill took place at Moulsey Hurst, on Tuesday, the 8th of December,
1818, where the amateurs met more numerously than could be expected,
considering this battle was only two days after that of Randall and Turner.
The name of Scroggins still made some impression on the fancy; but the
odds were six to four and two to one against him. It was four years previous
(December 8, 1814), on the same spot of ground that the celebrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>Dutch Sam lost his laurels with Nosworthy; and it was also on the same
piece of turf that Scroggins conquered Nosworthy, in the short space of
eighteen minutes. The little hero seemed as if animated by the recollection
of this affair, and looked more than cheerful. Martin appeared in the ring
first, and threw up his hat, attended by Oliver and Ben Burn as his seconds;
Scroggins, attended by Belcher and Richmond, soon followed. Both men
were in good condition, particularly Martin. Randall was present, and frequently
encouraged Scroggins by offering to bet upon him. At one o’clock
the men shook hands, and the battle commenced. Mr. Gully was the umpire.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Scroggins with smiling confidence
set-to, but Martin did not seem eager
to go to work. Some long sparring occurred,
when Scroggins hit first, which was returned
by Martin. Some exchanges; the men
closed, and Scroggy got Martin down.
(Shouts of applause, and “Bravo Scroggins!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The forehead of the Baker appeared
rather raised, and Scroggy gave him another
nobber with his right hand. The latter
endeavoured to make a rush, but was stopped
by a facer. The round was finished by some
sharp fighting; both went down, Martin
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The Baker did not take the lead in
that high style which had been anticipated.
Scroggins, with much dexterity, planted a
desperate hit on the side of the Baker’s right
ear. Martin returned upon him, and they
fought sharply at the ropes till both went
down, and Martin undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Martin endeavoured to put in a sharp
nobber, but Scroggy, smiling at his efforts,
stopped it cleverly. In closing, both down,
when Scroggins again got his opponent
undermost. (Loud shouting, and “Go it,
Scroggy.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Martin put in some good hits, and
followed Scroggins to the ropes, when the
little one, with lion-hearted resolution, returned
upon him and drove him back, planting
some sharp blows. In struggling for
the throw, Scroggins was undermost. (The
high odds on the Baker had changed, and in
many parts of the ring it was even betting.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Scroggins showed good science, and
appeared not so easy to be got at as Martin
had anticipated. The latter paused a good
deal before he attempted to hit. After some
milling on both sides, Scroggins got Martin
down in the close, and undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Scroggins hit Martin twice, and sent
him out of the ring. (Thunders of approbation,
and “The little hero is as good as
ever,” was the cry.)</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Although Martin did not perform what
was expected, or smash his opponent off
hand, yet ultimately it was thought he would
be victorious. Scroggins hit and got away in
good style. Martin again paused. At length
they commenced fighting, and Scroggins’
nose was severely pinked. Both down,
Scroggins undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>9 to 12.—Displayed no particular points,
reciprocal in most instances; the youth and
strength of Martin the principal advantages.</p>

<p class='c022'>13 to 16.—The former three rounds displayed
little variation; but the latter was
excellent. Scroggins got Martin at the
ropes in such a peculiar situation that he
might have severely punished him with ease
and effect, but disdained to take any advantage,
holding up his hands and walking
away. (Tumultuous applause from all parts
of the ring at his manly conduct. But it
was observed by the judges of pugilism that
Scroggins had given a chance away, and this
generosity might eventually lose him the
battle.)</p>

<p class='c022'>17 to 24.—In all these rounds it would be
difficult to assign the “best” to either.
Scroggins was rushing in to make a hit,
when Martin stopped him, but the latter fell
from weakness.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—This was a good round. Martin hit
and got away; and Scroggy also stopped
with judgment. In closing, Scroggins threw
Martin out of the ring. (Shouts of applause.)</p>

<p class='c022'>26 to 28.—Scroggins laughed at Martin,
when the latter ran in and gave him a
nobber for it. Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>29 to 32.—These were milling rounds, and
good on both sides. Counter hits passed.
The nose of Scroggy looked rather queer,
but he made some excellent stops. Martin’s
right eye was damaged. In closing, Scroggins
acted again with much manliness, disdaining
to fall upon the Baker, which he
might have done. (Applause, and two to
one was offered in some places by the friends
of Scroggins.)</p>

<p class='c022'>33, 34.—The amateurs felt rather astonished
that nothing decisive had as yet been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>effected. Scroggins showed good science,
good pluck, full of laughter, and proved an
ugly customer for the Baker. Martin in this
round met Scroggins well as he was coming
in by a facer; but the latter returned, and
in closing, fell upon him heavily. He said
to his second. “It is as right as the day,”
meaning he should win it.</p>

<p class='c022'>35 to 37.—Martin bled in the latter round
from severe facers. Both down, but Martin
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>38.—Cautious sparring, during which time
Scroggins smilingly observed to Martin, “I
am not so easy a customer, Jack, as you expected.”
“Never mind,” replied Martin;
“how are you to win it?” Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>39.—Scroggins hit down just above the
mark.</p>

<p class='c022'>40 to 45.—Scroggins began playing some
antics with his feet, not unlike his displays
of fun at the Fives Court. He seemed quite
at ease, and some parts of the ring took him
for choice as an old favourite. One hour
and thirty-two minutes had elapsed, and
nothing decisive done, excepting that the
youth of Martin was likely to serve longest.</p>

<p class='c022'>46.—The face of Scroggins was the worse
for the fight; Martin was piping—his mug,
too, rather changed, but he scarcely bled.</p>

<p class='c022'>47 to 50.—They both got weak, and Martin
went down from some hits, each frequently
gave a “hem” for wind. Scroggins received
a dreadful floorer on the nob that appeared
to make him so groggy that he did not know
where he was, and the cry was, “It is all
up.” Oliver took off his hat—the spectators
run from the outer ring towards the ropes;
some confusion ensued, and the horsewhips
went to work to clear the ground; the time-keeper
found himself pressed upon by the
crowd, and for safety got into the roped
ring; order was at length restored; but it
is thought a minute and a half elapsed before
“Time” could be or was called. Great
murmurings occurred from the friends of
Martin. Belcher here showed his excellent
qualities as a second.</p>

<p class='c022'>51.—Scroggy recovered, to the astonishment
of the ring; the 51st, 52nd, 53rd, and
54th rounds were downright milling, and
Scroggins was as good as his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>55.—Scroggins floored Martin, and took
the bottle to drink himself.</p>

<p class='c022'>56 to 66.—To describe these rounds would
be impossible; both men fought in the most
distressed state, yet more execution was done
in them than in the whole fight put together.
The men continued fighting till they absolutely
rolled against each other; in fact, till
the hitting had left them both, and it was
thought once Martin had lost it, it being
difficult to get him off the ground, but he
revived a little and sent Scroggy down, when
he could not come again. It was anybody’s
battle at last—the toss up of a halfpenny.
As a proof of the nicety of the thing, in the
63rd round Martin was hit down. 64th,
Scroggins down. 65th, both down. Two
hours and two minutes had elapsed, Scroggy
in a state of stupor, and Martin little better.
The latter, however, walked to a post-chaise,
and received loud cheers from the
spectators.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—In point of fame, Scroggins
did not lose one inch of ground, although
the decision of the fight was against him.
He was, however, more punished than in any
other of his battles; he also showed more
science, and evinced game of the first quality.
Martin is nothing else but a good and
a game man; but in taking two hours to
beat a stale one, and that too merely from
chance (excepting the 50th round, when the
ring was broken, which, in point of truth,
was in his favour), operates as a considerable
drawback towards establishing a character
as a first-rate finishing fighter. It
was the constitution of Martin that won it.
With a man of fine science it becomes a
question as to what place on the list he
might claim. The amateurs expected much
more from him. Martin also was severely
punished.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scroggins showed in town on the Friday following, but not in an exact
state to sit for his likeness, when the little hero observed, “that Martin was
the best man he had ever been opposed to.” Martin was very ill, and did
not arrive in town for several days.</p>

<p class='c007'>The success of Martin now prompted him to obtain a higher situation
among the milling heroes; he therefore entered the lists with Randall. (See
<span class='sc'>Randall</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 346.) In this contest his enterprising spirit received a
check, and he was doomed to experience defeat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Martin, it seems, was not dismayed at the above reverse of fortune, but
endeavoured to recover his lost laurel with the game and scientific Turner.
(See <span class='sc'>Turner</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 387.) In this battle Martin also experienced defeat.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>To use his own words upon this occasion, Martin observed, “he should not
have been satisfied in his own mind if he had not fought with Randall and
Turner.” He also, with great candour, stated “that these heroes were too
good fighters for him, and he therefore acknowledged, with the utmost
sincerity, they were his superiors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Martin, in addition to his milling capabilities, was also a good pedestrian.
Previous to his battle with Scroggins, he offered to make the best of his way
to Brighton, a distance of fifty miles, in eight hours, for a wager of fifty
guineas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Master of the Rolls, always ready to fight, accepted a challenge from
Joshua Hudson for fifty guineas a-side. This affair took place on Tuesday,
December 14, 1819, at Colnbrook, in Buckinghamshire, eighteen miles from
Hyde Park Corner. Hounslow Heath originally was the appointed place,
but the beadle of the parish gave the hint it would be stopped, and “a beak”
shortly afterwards confirmed the injunction. The motley group then pushed
forwards to Colnbrook, where a field was soon procured, and at three o’clock
Martin, followed by Spring and Randall, threw up his hat. Hudson shortly
afterwards appeared, accompanied by Tom Belcher and Clarke. The parties
soon shook hands and set to. Six to four on Hudson.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Hudson appeared in the highest
condition—good humour, manliness,
and confidence seemed smiling on his brow.
Martin looked equally well, and there was a
steady composure about him, as if victory
was his sole intention. It was generally
expected that a slashing fight would be the
result, from the well-known bull-dog qualities
of Hudson; but, upon the combatants
placing themselves in attitudes, a minute
elapsed in manœuvring, both anxious to obtain
the first advantage. At length Martin
let fly, hit Hudson’s left shoulder, and
also got away. The latter endeavoured to
plant a severe right-handed blow, which
Martin stopped cleverly. Sparring was again
resorted to, and caution used on both sides.
Some trifling exchanges took place, when
Hudson put in a tremendous hit under
Martin’s left ogle, that not only measured it
for a suit of mourning, but the claret instantly
followed. This conduct rather surprised
Martin, but he endeavoured to return
with his left hand. More sparring. The
combatants now made counter hits on the
mouth, but the blow from Hudson seemed
most effective. Martin tried to make one
of his severe right-handed hits, which was
stopped, when Hudson, in return, put in
so severe a facer, that Martin went staggering
away two yards towards the ropes, and it
was expected he must have gone down. The
blood was now seen trickling from his nose.
Some more cautious manœuvring occurred,
when the men fought their way into a close,
and both went down, Martin undermost.
Loud shouting, “Bravo, Hudson—£100 on
Josh.”—Six and seven to four were currently
offered. This round occupied upwards of
seven minutes and a half.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The appearance of Martin was much
against him; in fact, he looked rather exhausted.
The blow he had received on his
eye was on the same that Randall and
Turner had so severely peppered. Martin
got away from a well-directed facer meant
by Hudson, and, in return, put in a severe
blow on the ribs of his opponent. Some
little sparring, but fighting was the order of
this round. Martin soon received a severe
“snorter” that produced the “pink” instantly;
but after this blow he had it all his
own way. With his right hand he planted a
blow just above the temple of Hudson, which
looked red, and also put in a sharp hit under
the left ear of his opponent. Josh seemed
rather staggered, but he returned manfully
to the charge, and some exchanges took
place in a partial close, till they got out of
it, when Martin made himself up, and a tremendous
hit, which he put in upon the point
of Hudson’s left shoulder, operated so powerfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>that, he turned pale, and staggered towards
the ropes in a confused state, and
Randall bid Martin follow up his success.
The accident was not known at this period,
and Hudson was too good to fall. Martin
now approached him, and, with a slight left-handed
blow on Hudson’s head the latter
went down.—“Well done, Martin; that’s
the time of day to win.” During the time
Hudson sat on his second’s knee he communicated
to them that his shoulder was dislocated;
and on “Time” being called victory
of course was declared in favour of Martin.
The fight was over in nine minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—There is scarcely room for
observation, in consequence of the shortness
of the contest, but the general opinion of
the ring was that Hudson would ultimately
have proved the conqueror. Fortunately, a
medical man was upon the spot, and Hudson’s
shoulder was set in less than five
minutes afterwards. The accident he thought
little about; but he shed tears on losing the
victory. Hudson walked about the ring
afterwards, and appeared at the Castle
Tavern in the evening with his arm in a
sling.</p>

<p class='c013'>Martin, it seems, determined to keep the game alive, made no hesitation in
entering the ring against the “iron-hitting Cabbage,” as the latter was
termed. This battle was for one hundred guineas a-side, and took place on
Tuesday, March 28, 1820, at Farnham Royal, near Dawney Common, contiguous
to Stoke House, near Stowe, Buckinghamshire, twenty-four miles
from London. Maidenhead Thicket, in Berkshire, a distance of twenty-nine
miles from the Metropolis, was the spot fixed upon for the day’s play,
and the length of road made it necessary for the amateurs to start as soon as
daylight peeped. The “toddlers” were quite out of it, as nothing but good
“prads” could attempt a distance of sixty miles. The stage-coaches made
out well upon the occasion; and, notwithstanding the numerous vehicles of
this sort upon this great road, many amateurs were disappointed. There
was considerable attraction about the contest, and a greater sprinkling of
Corinthians than usual adorned the ring with their presence. Cabbage had
derived great notoriety from being the champion of the light weights in
Bristol, and also for being one of the most determined boxers on the list.
A large company mustered at an early hour in the town of Maidenhead;
but one of the beaks, it seems, got hold of the scent, and a warrant was
issued against Cabbage. This circumstance alarmed the milling coves; it
was soon communicated to the motley throng that “it wouldn’t do;” so
Gibbons brushed off with the stakes, and formed the ring at Farnham Royal,
in a field of private property, without delay; and thither he was followed by
horse and foot in rapid confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>At thirty-seven minutes past one o’clock Martin appeared and threw his
hat in the ring, followed by Oliver and Randall as his seconds; Cabbage soon
appeared, attended by Cribb and Clarke. Randall tied the blue colours to
the stakes, and Cribb covered them with the yellow-man belonging to Cabbage.
It was seven to four current betting in favour of the latter—in many
places two to one.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The condition of Cabbage was
tiptop; he was as fine as a star, and his
frame compact and firm as an oak. Not
so Martin, he did not look well, was not
fit to fight, and had also had a recent attack
of rheumatism. Some trifling sparring,
when Martin made a hit, which was well
stopped by Cabbage. The Master of the
Rolls appeared clever compared with the
rough customer before him, availed himself
of the science he possessed, and put in two
nobbers, but not heavily, when Cabbage
rushed in, and both went down. Two to one
on Martin.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Both combatants made offers, but retreated
sparring. The right hand of Martin
again nobbed his opponent, and Cabbage in
return attempted to be busy. Both down,
but Martin undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Although Cabbage was decidedly the
favourite, it was evident he was no fighter,
but showed amazing strength and resolution.
Martin got away from him, and attempted
to put in a severe bodier, and also one on
the head; but the rushing qualities of the
latter bored Martin to the ropes, where,
after a severe struggle, both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>4, 5.—Martin showed science, still the
odds were getting up against him, and Richmond
observed he would not take ten to one
and stand it.</p>

<p class='c022'>6 to 10.—A slight tinge of the claret was
seen on Martin’s face, and he appeared
weak. It was almost booked that he would
be tired out, as his strength seemed fast
leaving him.</p>

<p class='c022'>11 to 24.—In all these rounds, notwithstanding
Martin put in repeated facers,
little impression appeared to have been
made on the iron mug of Cabbage until this
round, when his right eye received a severe
hit upon an already damaged place, and bled.</p>

<p class='c022'>25 to 41.—The amateurs expressed themselves
much disappointed in Cabbage, and
the Commander-in-chief<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c009'><sup>[161]</sup></a> declared “he saw
no choice between them.”</p>

<p class='c022'>42 to 48.—Cabbage was now so much the
favourite that three to one was laid upon
him.</p>

<p class='c022'>49 to 60.—Martin still kept nobbing his
opponent, but he could not reduce his
strength. The Master of the Rolls was also
getting very weak, and fell down at times
exhausted. It was a manly, good-natured
contest, and the combatants behaved to each
other fairly in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c022'>61 to 70.—It was thought by a few that
Martin was now getting the best of it, and
Randall said it was all right. But this was
not the general opinion.</p>

<p class='c022'>71 to 73.—Martin, encouraged, took the
lead, and Randall again assured him “It
was as safe as the Bank.”</p>

<p class='c022'>74.—Martin stopped Cabbage, gave him a
facer, and ran him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>75th and last.—In this round, in struggling
together, Cabbage got a sudden jerk
or twist on the neck, that totally disabled
him from showing at the scratch when time
was called. A medical man immediately
rendered him his assistance, and he was
taken from the ring. The fight lasted one
hour eleven minutes and a half. Great
danger appeared, and it was thought Cabbage
would not recover.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Few, if any, remarks are
needed upon the above contest. Cabbage
belonged to the same school as Scroggins,
depending upon rushing forwards, and was
positively a chance hitter. His left hand
was always open, and he continually hit
round the neck of Martin. It was thought
that Cabbage would never be able to cut
any figure amongst the London boxers, and
it was also urged, from the above specimen,
that he was the worst pugilist from the renowned
Bristol nursery. Martin, in winning
this fight, raised himself considerably
in the estimation of the fancy. He
was extremely ill, very weak, and not fit to
fight.</p>

<p class='c013'>One evening, in the month of June, 1820, it appears that six well-dressed
blackguards were returning from the Coburg Theatre,<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c009'><sup>[162]</sup></a> about eleven o’clock,
and for a “bit of a lark” endeavoured to take a respectable young woman
from her husband, when the latter in the most manly way resented the
insult, but was overpowered by numbers. The Master of the Rolls was
accidentally passing at the time with a friend. The latter immediately
remonstrated with the “dandies” upon the impropriety of their conduct, but
he received a facer for his interference, and one or two of the party also
struck at the Master of the Rolls. This was enough, or rather too much, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>Martin. He let fly his right on the nob of the first that approached him, and
the dandy went down as if he had been shot; the second shared the same
fate; the third was no better off; the fourth came in for “pepper;” the
fifth got a severe “quilting;” and the sixth received for his insolence so
severe a blow on his mouth as to dislodge some of his ivory. It was truly
laughable to see the ridiculous pickle these bullies were in, the claret trickling
down their cheeks, and holding their hands up to their heads. When
Martin’s friend exclaimed, “Go it, Martin, give it them,” the name operated
like a thunder-clap upon their nerves, and they bolted like race-horses in
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauve qui peut</span></i>. Martin lost part of his coat in the scuffle, but did not
receive a scratch upon his person.</p>

<p class='c007'>The charms of a purse of £50, given by the Pugilistic Club, at Norwich,
and also £25 a-side, induced Martin to enter the ring with Sampson (denominated
the Birmingham Youth), at North Walsham, sixteen miles from the
above city, on Monday, July 17, 1820, immediately after the battle between
Oliver and Painter. Sampson was seconded by Turner, and Paul from Manchester.
Martin was attended by the Champion of England and Spring.
The odds were six to four on Martin; in fact, it was almost booked that he
must win.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On stripping, Martin appeared
in prime condition, and his legs being decorated
in ribbed silk stockings, gave him an
attractive appearance. Sampson was also
well, but had too much of the greyhound
about his loins, to indicate the possession of
strength. Sampson did not appear so eager
to go to work as had been anticipated, and a
considerable pause occurred before any blows
were attempted to be made. At length
Martin made an offer with his left hand, but
Sampson got away. Another long pause,
when Sampson put down his hands as if
tired. Martin made another attempt to hit,
but Sampson again retreated. A sort of
rush took place between the combatants;
some sharp hits were exchanged, and, in
closing at the ropes, Martin fibbed his opponent,
and also put in a heavy blow on Sampson’s
neck, when both went down. (Loud
shouting, and seven to four on Martin.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Martin now stood to no repairs, but
rushed in upon Sampson. Some exchanges
occurred, when, in closing, Martin pulled
down his opponent, and fell heavily upon
him.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—This was a sharp round, and something
like pepper occurred on both sides.
Severe fibbing at the ropes, and, in struggling
for the throw, Sampson was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—The claret was now trickling down
both their faces, and one of Martin’s peepers
appeared rather damaged. The latter run
in, and endeavoured to put in a most tremendous
facer, but missed his aim, and had
nearly slipped down. Martin, however,
caught hold of Sampson, and ran him down.
(Two to one on Martin; but some marks of
disapprobation were expressed by the Johnny
Raws.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Sampson missed a hit, and went round.
Martin slipped down in running after him,
but got up again, when some sharp blows
were exchanged, till both of them went
down. Thirteen minutes had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Sampson had been very busy, and
Martin’s face exhibited some severe punishment.
His left eye was bleeding. Both
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Sampson, with considerable dexterity,
broke away from the weaving system. It
was altogether a good round, till both measured
their lengths on the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Martin missed a hit, and ran himself
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—The Master of the Rolls slipped about
all over the ring, as if he had been sliding
on a pond, and at length went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Martin run Sampson out of the ropes.
Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—It was complete pully-haully on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>part of Martin, and he fell heavily on his
opponent. (Disapprobation.)</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Sampson fought well, and with great
spirit, but he could not resist the strength of
Martin. Sampson was severely fibbed at
the ropes, till both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>13, 14.—From superior strength, Martin
had the best of these rounds.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Sampson went to work in great style.
He nobbed his opponent, fibbed him terribly
at the ropes, and ultimately fell upon Martin.
(A great burst of applause from all
parts of the ring, and to Sampson the cry
was, “Another such a round and you may
win it.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Sampson commenced this round well,
and again sharply nobbed his opponent; but
Martin run in upon him, and by main
strength pulled Sampson down by his thighs
at the ropes. “Foul, foul.” “Fair, fair.”
But the umpire did not notice it.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—At the ropes Sampson was so weak
that he could not hit Martin, when the latter
kept administering pepper severely, till his
opponent went down. It was evident Martin’s
strength could now win it.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Martin went down after a few exchanges.
(Great shouting for Sampson; and
the expressions were, “We wish he may win
it, because he has fought so well.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Martin now had got his opponent to
his wishes; he began to fight well, and
nobbed Sampson all over the ring. The
claret was running down his face in profusion.
The rain too was coming down in
torrents. (Two and three to one, but no
takers.) Thirty minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Sampson went down from a severe
blow in the wind market. He could hardly
be got up.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Sampson was much distressed, and
soon went down. (“Take him away, he
can’t win it.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—Sampson again down, but he would
not give in.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Sampson was going very fast: he had
not a shadow of chance.</p>

<p class='c022'>24 to 27.—All but gone; and a guinea to
a shilling was offered.</p>

<p class='c022'>28, 29, and last.—Sampson, after being
hit down, could not come to the scratch
when “Time” was called; and Martin of
course was pronounced the victor.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—This fight did not add to the
reputation of Martin; on the contrary, it
tended to reduce him in the estimation of
the amateurs as a scientific boxer. He defeated
Sampson more from pulling and
hauling than from severity of hitting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Martin, who was on a sparring tour, met with a little job on the second
day of the Lewes races, Friday, August 11, 1820, in consequence of a Gipsy
having boldly offered to fight any man on the ground. A purse of twenty-five
guineas was made up, and so confident was the Gipsy of victory, that he
begged the money (£6 or £7), collected for the loser, might be added to the
fund for the winner, which was accordingly done. Clarke seconded Martin,
and Davis the Gipsy. The battle was in a roped ring, and lasted seventeen
minutes. It is unnecessary to give the details of the ten rounds. The
Gipsy’s strength was foiled by the Baker’s science, and Martin gained an easy
conquest. The Gipsy was severely punished. Martin scarcely received a
scratch, and afterwards walked to Brighton. Oliver was time-keeper. The
greatest order prevailed, and it was quite a treat to many of the fashionable
visitors at Brighton, and to the country joskins.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above fight also, it seems, rather tended to reduce than raise Martin’s
character as a pugilist. Indeed, so much so that David Hudson was matched
against Martin with the utmost confidence for fifty guineas a side. This
match took place at Moulsey Hurst, on Tuesday, October 24, 1820.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bright Sol put the fanciers all in high spirits, and the swells and kids left
their beds with the expectation of having a gay milling day. Moulsey
Hurst, that delightful spot for a scientific contest, was again the appointed
place to muster, and the Bonifaces along the road, as soon as the office was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>given, were seen rubbing their hands, their mugs smiling with glee, and
upon the look-out to welcome the old faces once more to their houses. The
Daffy Club, with its president, gave Bill Just a turn, at the Half-way House,
the Waggon and Horses, Kew Bridge, and Bob Lawrence’s, at Hampton, were
overflowing with company in every part. The road, at an early period, exhibited
lots of vehicles, and when the rain came on the lads were too game
even to mention it, except observing one to another, “Push along, keep
moving.” In a heavy shower of rain, at half-past one, Martin appeared, and
threw his hat in the ring, but the high wind blew it out. Martin did not
like this omen; he went and picked it up, and again threw it in the ring.
Dav. Hudson appeared soon afterwards, and threw his hat also in the ring.
Both the combatants were loudly applauded. Owen and Belcher were the
seconds for David Hudson; and Randall and Spring officiated for Martin.
The odds were in favour of Hudson; in fact, it was booked to a certainty that
the latter must win, and nothing else. Five and six to four against Martin.
Hudson tied his colours, the yellow-man, to the stakes, Tom Owen, observing,
at the same time, he was the best little man in England; and Spring tied
the blue handkerchief for Martin over them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On stripping, both men appeared
in the highest condition. Numerous
as prize-fights have been, one of the greatest
novelties occurred in the first round that had
been witnessed. The men stood before each
other for upwards of seven minutes in attitude,
without making an attempt to hit.
The steadiness of Martin was beautiful, and
his length was so impressive that Hudson
was all caution, and did not like to give the
first blow. The latter was at length tired,
and put down his hands, saying, “Martin, if
you do not give a hit, I shall wait all day.”
Hudson, however, made an offer, and Martin
got away. Hudson again made a hit,
which Martin stopped, and, in return, with
his left hand he gave the latter a facer.
The combatants closed, but broke away,
when Martin nobbed his opponent in style.
Another close took place, and, in breaking
away, Martin had again the best of his
opponent. Some blows were exchanged,
and, in closing, both down. The shouting
was loud on both sides; but Martin was the
favourite ten to seven. This round occupied
ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The superiority of Martin not only
astonished the ring, but Hudson could not
reach him; his right hand, in all his former
fights, was dreadful, but he now used his
left hand with equal facility. He drew
the first blood on Hudson’s right cheek;
but, in closing, both down. (“Martin for
£100.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The goodness of Hudson was the praise
of the ring, but he was overmatched. Martin
was nearly a stone heavier than his
opponent. The length of Martin enabled
him to put in facers with ease, but Hudson
returned, and got Martin down. (Loud
shouting.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—This was a short round, and ultimately
in favour of Martin. Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Hudson showed he was not deficient
in strength, and, in closing this round, he
threw Martin with considerable dexterity.</p>

<p class='c022'>6, 7.—The confidence of the amateurs began
to forsake them, and Martin was the
hero of the tale; his steadiness and fine
fighting quite astonished all present; in fact,
he was quite a general, till both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Hudson received a dreadful blow on
the top of his nose, which produced the
claret instantly; but he attacked Martin
with all the gameness of a man determined
to obtain victory, till the round finished.
Both down. (Seven to four on Martin.)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—From the situation in which the men
were placed, it was evident that Martin must
prove the conqueror. Hudson was too short
to commence the attack: he could not plant
a hit with any degree of safety; in fact, he
was beaten at both points—at in and out
fighting. Martin went down from a slip.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>10, 11.—In straggling for the throws, also,
Martin showed improved qualities.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—After considerable difficulty at the
ropes, Martin went down; but Hudson was
severely fibbed by Martin.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—This was altogether a fine round on
both sides. The courage of Hudson was of
the highest quality; but there was a mastery
about the science of Martin that astonished
the ring, on reflection, that ever Randall or
Turner should have defeated him. Martin
hit Hudson terribly in the body, and also
nobbed him till he went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Hudson’s left eye was nearly closed,
and he had been much distressed for wind in
several of the preceding rounds, but Martin
was a little weak, and went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Every round was now closing to the
disadvantage of Hudson. The length of
Martin enabled him to hit his opponent in
all directions, till he went down exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Hudson now appeared like a drunken
man, and came staggering to the scratch,
when Martin hit Hudson away from him
three times, with severe facers and also
punished him down. (“It’s all up,” was the
general cry.) Martin slipped down.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—It was only the goodness of Hudson
that could have induced him to continue the
contest. His hits were short; in fact, he
could not get at Martin, the guard of the
latter was so lengthy and firm. Hudson
again received some tremendous nobbers on
the right side of his head, till he went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>18 and last.—Hudson was punished in all
directions till he went down. He was lifted
up by his seconds, but when time was called
he could not answer the sound, and victory
was of course declared in favour of Martin,
in thirty-nine minutes and ten seconds.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Martin, it seems, was held
much too cheap. It was expected by the
amateurs in general that he would have
been beaten off hand. He has, however,
raised himself by his superior fighting in
this battle to the top of the tree. He has
conquered one of the best little men of the
day, with a heart like a lion, and considered
also a first-rate boxer. This circumstance
alone is saying a great deal for him in the
sporting world; but he has also conquered
in succession, Josh. Hudson, Cabbage, the
Birmingham youth, a big Johnny Raw, at
the Lewes Races, and, lastly, Dav. Hudson.
Martin has only been defeated by Randall
and Turner; and the former has also beaten
Oliver’s brother, Paddington Johnson, and
the hardy Scroggins. Hudson did not hit
Martin heavily, while the blows of the latter
operated with the severity of a horse’s kick,
and he retired from the ring little the worse
for blows. Martin could have beaten another
Dav. Hudson in the same ring. The latter
was severely punished. Martin weighed
eleven stone six pounds on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have already noticed Martin’s pedestrian capabilities. On Thursday,
March 11, 1819, at Brixton Causeway, Martin cleverly defeated a well
known runner, “the Chicken Butcher,” in a half mile race for £10, the
professional giving Martin a start of twenty-five yards.</p>

<p class='c007'>Martin now considered that experience and success in the ring would
justify him in calling upon Turner for a second trial of skill. Preliminaries
were arranged and Tuesday, June 5, 1821, appointed as the day of battle.
The rendezvous was Crawley Hurst. The cognoscenti booked this affair as a
“gift” of 100 guineas to Turner; and as he had beaten Martin so cleverly
in 1819, in one hour and seven minutes, with a bad knee, it was now betted
evens that he won the battle within an hour. Turner was first in the ring,
attended by Tom Belcher and Randall; Martin soon after him, waited upon
by Tom Spring and a Norwich amateur. Colours—light blue for Martin,
and dark blue for Turner, were tied to the stakes by their respective seconds,
and the men stood up for</p>

<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The Master of the Rolls commenced
practice without delay, but hit short
with the right hand, Turner getting away.
Martin, not dismayed, followed Turner so
quickly, endeavouring to plant some hits,
that the latter was nearly falling, but he
recovered his balance, when an exchange of
blows occurred. Martin appeared so impetuous
in his attack, that Turner sung out,
“Hollo! hollo! Go it, my lad!” The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>Master of the Rolls planted a heavy blow on
Turner’s throat. A pause. Turner got
away from some blows, and, with his left
hand put in a severe hit on Martin’s eye,
which almost closed it. Martin, with his
left hand, gave a heavy body blow; he also
put in a facer. Ned now went to work,
sharp blows passed between them, and, in
closing, the weaving system was resorted to,
till both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Turner hit Martin’s guard down. A
pause. Ned’s left hand again told on the nob
of his opponent, and he got away. In closing
at the ropes, some sharp milling took place,
when Turner was down, and undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—It was evident that Martin meant
nothing but fighting, and they alternately
followed each other over the ring. In closing,
Martin held Turner fast, and punished
him till he slipped or went down from a
slight blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Martin confidently put in another body
blow, and also a facer, when Turner was
nearly falling, but he recovered his position.
This was a good round; both men fought
till they were distressed, and the knees of
Turner trembled considerably. Martin bored
in, and got Turner down.</p>

<p class='c022'>5, 6, and 7.—These rounds were well contested,
and although Turner fought at points
he did not do that execution which had been
so decidedly witnessed in his former battles.
Martin, however, showed the first blood.</p>

<p class='c022'>8 to 11.—Turner stood well in the opinion
of the amateurs. He had proved himself a
game man, a dangerous fighter, and one
that would not go away for a trifle; but if
Turner put in a hit, he got a blow in return
for it. Martin fell very heavy on Turner.
Randall cried out to Martin he would bet
seven to four. “I’ll take it,” answered
Martin, and went to work to win it.</p>

<p class='c022'>12 to 15.—Martin put in several severe
blows about the lower ribs of his opponent,
and also some facers. In fact, Martin was
now getting the best of it; but the friends of
Turner were so much attached to him they
could not perceive the fact.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—The Master of the Rolls put in a
batch of hits—three facers without a return.
Turner endeavoured to turn this round in
his favour, but, on the contrary, Martin put
in a severe body blow, and Turner fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—A long pause. At in-fighting Martin
proved himself the best man; he also put in
a blow on the nose of his opponent that produced
the claret. In closing, Turner went
down, undermost. The odds were all used
up, and even betting, but Martin for choice.</p>

<p class='c022'>18, 19.—Turner went down awkwardly.
Murmurings, and an appeal to the umpires.
Several amateurs insisted Turner went down
without a blow, but the fight went on.</p>

<p class='c022'>20 to 25.—Martin, in the whole of these
rounds, if he did not show off in style, had
the best of them.</p>

<p class='c022'>26 to 30.—In the last round, on Turner’s going
down, an appeal was made to the umpires.</p>

<p class='c022'>31 to 36.—Turner could not stop the body
blows of his opponent; in fact, he was getting
weak, and also getting the worst of it.
(“One hour,” said the time-keeper, “has
passed away.” Martin answered, “I can
fight for six hours.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>37 to 40.—Two to one in favour of Martin.
An appeal was made to the umpires that
Turner had again gone down without a blow.
“You are mistaken,” said one of the umpires,
“I should not like to have had it.” The
other umpire appeared to have doubts on
the subject, when the referee observed he
saw nothing foul.</p>

<p class='c022'>41.—Martin put in another body blow
without any return being made. Some blows
were exchanged as Martin followed Turner
over the ring, when the latter went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>42.—Both down after an exchange of
blows.</p>

<p class='c022'>43.—Turner seemed getting second wind,
and put in a severe left-handed hit on Martin’s
forehead that made the claret follow
profusely. “It’s all right now,” said a few
of the over-the-water-boys; “give him the
Bermondsey screw, Ned.” Martin, although
getting the worst of this round, followed up
his opponent till he went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>44, 45.—Turner made some sharp hits, but
was down in both these rounds.</p>

<p class='c022'>46.—Turner hit Martin bang in the head,
and got away. Some exchanges were made,
and when Martin followed Turner, the latter
once more dropped; the former again
remarked “That Ned went down without a
blow,” and immediately went up to the umpires
to complain. “Foul, foul,” and “Fair,
fair,” resounded from all parts of the ring. In
consequence of so much scandalous dereliction
of duty, Martin, in a violent passion, said
“he was not used well,” and endeavoured to
get over the ropes: in fact, one of his legs
was half out, and he would have bolted if
Spring had not, with great presence of mind,
held him fast, and thus saved him from
losing the battle. Mr. Jackson here interfered,
and observed to the pugilists in the
ring, that neither the fighting men nor their
seconds had any right to interfere; nor, indeed,
any other person but the umpires, who
were appointed to watch the motions of the
men, and if they disagreed, then a final
appeal must be made to the referee.</p>

<p class='c022'>47.—Martin still appeared very angry, and
it was thought that he was giving a chance
away, from the effects of passion. But he
cooled upon it, a good round was the result,
and Martin sent Turner down. (Loud shouting
from the “dead men” party, and exclaiming,
“It’s all right again, and Jack’s
alive.”) Turner, while sitting on his second’s
knee, however, seemed to think he was winning
the battle, as he gave the office with a
smile to some of his friends, by putting one
of his fingers to his tongue.</p>

<p class='c022'>48 to 50.—Some fighting on both sides,
but Turner went down in all these rounds.</p>

<p class='c022'>51.—Turner put in a sharp facer. Martin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>followed him and exchanged blows. A trifling
pause. Martin, in following Turner
till down, again complained that he went
down without a hit. “I shall decide fairly,
depend upon it,” said Mr. Jackson; “he not
only received a hit, but his foot caught in a
hole,” pointing to the place.</p>

<p class='c022'>52 to 54.—The two first rounds were well
fought. In the last, Martin again made an
appeal to the umpires. Mr. Jackson repeated,
that if anything unfair occurred, the
umpires would notice it.</p>

<p class='c022'>55.—Exchanges. Martin put in a severe
facer. During a short pause Martin said,
“You are a game man, Ned but you must
lose it.” Ultimately Turner went down.
The latter appeared to hit round, and it
seemed as if one of his hands had gone.
Martin’s right hand was also in a bad state.</p>

<p class='c022'>56.—Turner was getting quite weak, but
he seemed to have no idea of losing. Martin
hit Turner on the head, and he went down
terribly distressed.</p>

<p class='c022'>57.—Both down, Martin uppermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>58.—Few, if any, persons round the ring
had an idea that the battle was so near
over. This was a severe round to Ned; in
fact, it was the tie-up of the fight. He
received a severe blow on the body, and
also a sharp one upon his head, when he
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>59.—Turner endeavoured to make play,
but it was all up. Martin fibbed him severely
at the ropes, got Turner down, and fell on
him with his knee nearly on his throat.</p>

<p class='c022'>60 and last.—In a struggle Martin fell
with all his weight on Turner. Turner was
placed on his second’s knee. Martin, who
was most anxiously viewing the state of his
brave but fallen opponent with one eye, was
with the other looking anxiously for the
umpires to call “time.” The game Turner
did not hear it, and Martin gave a jump on
being proclaimed the victor, and ran out of
the ring towards his vehicle. After Turner
had been taken care of, and led out of the
ring, Randall (apparently in great rage)
threw up his hat and offered to fight Martin
for £300 a-side, in three months. “I’ll bet
five to one,” said an amateur, “no one dares
to make it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The amateur, in offering the above bet, had miscalculated, for Martin,
having turned the tables upon one adversary, appeared to think it would be
an easy task to do so with another, and very shortly after the above fight
reminded Randall of his offer, and declared his readiness to accept it. This
was just the proposition that suited Randall, and the match being made,
came off, as we have already stated (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 351), on the 11th of September,
ending in the defeat of Martin, in one round and eight minutes and a half.</p>

<p class='c007'>Martin was matched for £100 a side with Aby Belasco, but the Jew’s
friends paid forfeit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following matrimonial announcement may serve as a specimen of
sporting paragraphs half a century ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Great Ring Match.</span>—None but the brave deserve the fair! A celebrated
pugilist, who has twice entered the lists with Randall, made a tie
with Turner, disposed of Oliver the second, conquered Paddington Johnson,
floored the hardy Scroggins, got the best of Josh. Hudson, polished off a big
Gipsy, caused Dav. Hudson to blink and Cabbage to wink, and finally
lowered the leek of the gallant Ned Turner—who has lately moreover become
known as a first-rate ‘turf-man,’ and at all times as an upright and well-behaved
man—appeared a few days since at the hymeneal scratch, at Lambeth,
where he duly signed articles (for a match of £2,500 down) with a
young lady, no time specified, but understood to be for life.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>Martin, from this period, was well known and universally respected. He
became a boniface, and it would have been well had he not been tempted to
return to the ring he had quitted as a conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a lapse of seven years, diversified only by a match with Jem Burn,
to fight in October 20, 1824, which ended in a “draw” of the stakes, Martin
was induced by irritated feelings to challenge young Dutch Sam (Samuel
Evans). The circumstances of his defeat, which took place November 4,
1828, at Knowle Hill, Berks, will be found under the memoir of the victor
in Period VI.</p>

<p class='c007'>Martin for many years was the landlord of the Crown at Croydon; he
subsequently removed to the Horns Tavern, Kennington. He finally retired,
first to St. Alban’s, and afterwards to a rural retreat in Devon, where he long
resided. He died in the year 1871, aged 75, having become a convert for many
years to the doctrines and practice of total abstinence from liquor, and a strict
vegetarian.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>JOHN PALMER, KNOWN IN THE P. R. AS “JACK SCROGGINS”—1803‒1822.</h4>

<p class='c013'>To whom this hardy little hero, who so long performed “clown to the
ring,” was indebted for his grotesque <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</span></i>, is a point upon which history
is silent, nor can its elucidation be expected, even from the editor of “Notes
and Queries,” assisted by his staff of contributors. There was, however, a
popular comic song by George Colman the Younger, in which the loves of
Giles Scroggins and Molly Brown were involved with “a horrible” ghost
story, and possibly the mere oddity of the name suggested itself as an <em>alias</em>
for this eccentric pugilist.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Palmer was born, December 31, 1787, near New Cross, Deptford.
It should seem that as Hercules in his cradle betook himself to serpent
strangling, by way of prefiguring his future monster-destroying propensities,
so Jack was pugilistic from his cradle; and, although not an ill-natured lad,
was continually fighting the boys of New Cross, till his victories were so
numerous, that he was considered as the cock of the walk. At a more
advanced age he went to live as a servant on the farm of Mr. Giblett (the
great butcher of Bond Street), at Kilburn. Here he had frequent turns-up
with the hardy race of navigators belonging to the Paddington Canal, and
here he first received the name of “Scroggins,” which continued with him
throughout his services in the navy, and stuck to him to the end of his boxing
career. The oddity of this nickname was merited by a corresponding
<em>grotesquerie</em> of personal gesture and appearance. In height only five feet four
inches, in weight hard upon eleven stone, “his appearance when stripped,”
says Boxiana, “is not unlike the stump of a large tree, and from his loins
upwards he looks like a man of fourteen stone.” Add to this, much native
humour, the antics of a merryman, undaunted courage, and a love of riotous
fun, and the reader will admit that the comic lyric poet of <cite>Bell’s Life in
London</cite> could not have chosen a better known or more comic public character
than “Ould Jack”—or, after his departure for another world of spirits beyond
the grave, “Ould Jack’s Ghost”—for the vehicle of his fancy facetiæ. What
follows here is a <em>resumé</em> of the introductory pages of the memoir of Scroggins
in “Boxiana.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>In May, 1803, when sixteen years old, he was ill-treated by one Bill
Walters, at the sign of the Waggon and Horses, at Brentford. Walters was
a full grown man, possessing strength and some knowledge of milling, but
Jack was not easily to be intimidated, and an immediate turn-up was the
result, in a field near the above inn. The battle continued upwards of an
hour, when Scroggy was proclaimed the victor. Jem Belcher witnessed the
mill, and praised Scroggy for the hardy courage he displayed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not long after this occurrence, Scroggins dined at a club-feast, at the sign
of the Swan, Sunbury Common. The harmony of the company experienced
great interruption from the improper conduct of a fellow named Sam Beak,
better known as the “Bully of Harrow.” His name was a sort of terror to
all present, and the company would have been compelled to endure his insolence
for the remainder of the evening, had it not been for the pluck of little
Scroggy, who insisted upon his quitting the room. The threat produced a
regular fight out of doors, and after a severe battle for nearly an hour, Beak
was glad to give in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scroggins also fought a brick-maker, weighing thirteen stone, near the
sign of the Fox and Goose, at Appleton, near Harrow-on-the-Hill. It was
thought by the spectators, from the great disproportion between the combatants,
that little Scroggy must ultimately be annihilated; but the smashing
activity of Jack reduced the brick-maker to his own pitch, when he finished
him off in quick time.</p>

<p class='c007'>A navigator, known by the appellation of Long Will, fought with Scroggins
near Harrow. It was a desperate battle, and contested with alternate
success for a long time, till victory crowned the exertions of our little hero.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Cowley, near Uxbridge, Scroggins entered the lists with Burke Smith,
denominated the second Robin Hood, from his attachment to deer, a man of
great activity, and distinguished for his great jumps over the canal. In the
hands of Scroggins he was soon glad to acknowledge he was defeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Billy Lee, the gipsy, had a desperate set-to with Scroggins, at Kilburn, in
the year 1804. The bruising qualities of the gipsy were well known in the
neighbourhood of Paddington; but Scroggins not only nobbed him severely,
but punished his body in such a hammering style that he hastily relinquished
the contest, acknowledging the superiority and goodness of our hero.</p>

<p class='c007'>By moonlight, at Kilburn, between twelve and one o’clock on a Friday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>night, a chap of the name of Blinko, otherwise designated as “No Nose!”
had a turn-up with Scroggins, but the severity “No Nose” met with, in the
course of a few rounds, induced him to give in. Upon being shown Scroggins
the next day, he said he was not the same he fought with, but would fight
him for the whole of his week’s wages on the next Sunday morning; but,
when the time arrived, “No Nose” was not to be found.</p>

<p class='c007'>A strong athletic farmer’s man, of the name of Bill King, was also beaten
by Scroggins, at Sandford Green, near Harrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Appleton, after a very severe battle, Jack Matney surrendered to the
conquering arm of Scroggins.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was owing to the following circumstance that our hero was compelled to
leave milling on land, to fight the battles of his country at sea, by entering
into the navy. In a row with one Ellis, a constable, at Sandford Green, the
representative of the law, it appears, felt rather heavily the indignation of
Scroggins. In consequence of which turn-up, an application was made to
the magistrate (Dr. Glasse), when our hero was depicted in such terrible
colours, that a press-gang of seventeen was considered necessary to convey
him in safety out of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the Point Beach at Portsmouth, Happy Jack, the terror of that then
uproarious seaport (so termed from the numerous conquests he had obtained
over various Jack-tars), was, in the presence of some thousands, wofully cut
down from the severe punishment he received in combat with Scroggins;
Happy Jack, for once in his life, being made miserable by defeat.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the time Scroggins was on board the Argo, the ship was a scene of
milling adventures, and, it should seem, when off duty, his leisure was filled
up in boxing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before our hero was suffered to realise the title of the Champion of the
Argo, the best men in the ship were pitted against him; but it would be
beneath the dignity of our history to record the undistinguished names of
the mere commoners who fell beneath the conquering arm of Scroggy, who,
notwithstanding his pugilistic <em>penchant</em>, was the life and soul of the ship, and
as remarkable for his readiness to assist a weaker messmate as to promote
the general mirth of the crew. His practical jokes and general good
humour were long the standing talk of the Argo’s galley. Toogood, a man
of colour, of first-rate weight, and possessing prodigious strength, had a
regular battle with our hero on board the Argo. Notwithstanding his
athletic powers, Scroggins compelled him to strike his colours.</p>

<p class='c007'>A caulker, a tall, strong, bony man, who came on board the Argo to make
some repairs, presuming on his strength, took off the boiler and placed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>frying-pan on the fire, in defiance of the whole mess. Scroggins at length
appeared, and took the fellow’s frying-pan from off the fire. A fight was the
immediate consequence; but the caulker was so often floored, met with such
severe punishment, and was so chaffed by the whole ship’s crew, that out of
revenge he complained to the captain of Scroggins, and our hero was compelled
to stand and take two dozen lashes, or, what is called in the old sea
phrase, a “dry holy-stoning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Scroggins had scarcely set his foot on terra firma, when he had a turn up
with two dragoons, before the door of the Prince of Wales, at Woolwich.
Notwithstanding the heavy force Scroggins had to contend against, our little
hero bustled through it with so much true courage, that in the course of a
few minutes he came off triumphant, having floored both the soldiers with
ease.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scroggins’ first battle in the ring, after his return from sea, was with Jack
Boots (whose real name was Wilford), at Wilsden Green, in 1814, for one
guinea a-side. It was a fight without training, and took place entirely from
accident. Boots, it seems, had previously talked about fighting our hero, and
both of them meeting at the above place to partake of the diversion afforded
by Caleb Baldwin’s Bull, they instantly agreed to decide the dispute in question,
upon Scroggins observing to Boots, “that he thought they were as
capable of amusing the amateurs as the bull had done.” In consequence of
this agreement the sports of the day closed, unexpectedly, with a regular
mill. Upon the bull’s quitting the ground a ring was immediately formed,
and Scroggins and Boots, without further preface, set-to. The latter was
well known, from having fought several battles; but Scroggins was a complete
stranger to the fighting circles. It was a punishing mill for sixty
minutes, during which period the pantomimic tricks exhibited by Scroggins
occasioned roars of laughter; he, however, displayed all the fortitude of a
sailor bent on obtaining victory. Anything like a regular system of tactics
he appeared to despise, and scrambled his way in to mill his adversary; but,
notwithstanding this nondescript boxing, his hits were so tremendously sent
home, that Boots could not resist their desperate effects. The friends of
Boots perceiving that he must eventually lose, were about to resort to some
manœuvres to prevent Scroggy from being proclaimed the conqueror. This
conduct was observed by old Joe Ward, who was standing in a cart viewing
the battle; and although he was severely afflicted with the rheumatism in
both knees, he hastily jumped out and made for the ring, where he insisted
upon fair play being observed between the combatants. Scroggins was
ultimately declared the victor. The spirited conduct of the latter so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>pleased the amateurs that £4 were collected for him as a reward for his
exertions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The friends of Scroggins, not without reason, thought, from this specimen,
that there was good stuff in him. Accordingly, Dolly Smith was selected as
a game active boxer, and a good trial man for the hardy little tar. The
battle was contested at Coombe Warren, on Wednesday, January 11, 1815,
in a twenty feet roped ring, for 20 guineas a-side. Smith was seconded by
Bill Cropley; Scroggins was attended by Richmond and Oliver.</p>

<p class='c007'>Smith was well known as a boxer, and considered a good man, from his
game battle with Dick Hares the previous year, on the same ground, while
Scroggins was scarcely known to any person connected with the ring. He
was viewed by the amateurs as an ambitious adventurer, a rough and daring
commoner, opposed to science and experience; the betting was, in consequence,
five to four upon Smith. The combatants in point of weight were
nearly equal. The first round proved a good specimen of the whole fight;
but the impetuosity of the “hardy tar” was so overwhelming, that the
science of Smith, however well applied, could not prevent its conquering
effects. Scroggins’ singular mode of attack astonished the spectators. Immediately
on receiving a hit from his opponent, he went resolutely in to mill,
protecting his head with his left hand over it, like a ship running in to
attack a fort or shore battery, dealing out terrible punishment with his right
hand, and thus took the lead and kept it, although he was opposed in the
most manly and skilful style by Smith, who was not long in darkening one
of the peepers of the sailor. Scroggins fought at the body with dogged
determination, and had the advantage in a striking degree in throwing,
Smith experiencing some severe cross-buttocks and desperate falls. Smith,
too, was frequently out of distance, and hit over instead of punishing his
adversary’s nob. It was a determined battle on both sides, and Smith did
not disgrace his character in defeat. The blows of Scroggins were terrible,
and he was never off his pins but once during the battle. For three quarters
of an hour it was rattling hard fighting, at the end of which time Smith was
so severely beaten, that he was compelled to cry “enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The milling fame which Nosworthy had acquired by his conquest of the
renowned but worn-out Dutch Sam, at Moulsey, on the 8th of December,
1814, rendered him an object of no small attraction in the milling sphere.
Scroggins, it seems, was eager to make a dash; his ambition soared above
commoners, and he viewed the victorious baker as a competitor worthy of his
aspirings. Some little time, however, elapsed before he was accommodated;
at last they met on the 6th of June, 1815, at Moulsey Hurst, for £50 a-side.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>Belcher and Gibbons seconded Scroggins; Cribb and Clark picked up Nosworthy.
The patrons of pugilism mustered very strongly upon this occasion,
and the “crusty coves” of the metropolis felt so confident the Master of
the Rolls would gain the cause, that, the evening previous to the fight, they
laid the odds of five to four with cheerfulness and alacrity. Nosworthy had
won his late battle with such seeming ease, that no doubt was entertained by
his admirers as to the issue. At one the men set-to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The notoriety Nosworthy had
obtained in conquering the Jew phenomenon
created intense interest, and every eye was
on the combatants setting to. A short time
elapsed in sparring, when Scroggins made a
good hit; the Baker, in return, missed his
aim. Some heavy milling occurred, when
they closed, and both went down; Nosworthy
undermost, Scroggins heavily on him.
(Five to four on Scroggins already.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Nosworthy appeared bleeding at the
scratch. Determined fighting was the order
of this round; and both the men seemed
bent upon proving each other’s courage.
Hit for hit was returned with as much indifference
as if their bodies were insensible
to feeling; and, although both of them were
frequently hit away, they returned to the
attack. The rally was dreadful, and Nosworthy
was, at length, sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—It was evident to the spectators that
Nosworthy had got enough to do to make a
win of it. No flinching on either side. They
stood up to each other like a couple of bull-dogs.
Scroggins took the lead in gallant
style, and punished his opponent in the most
terrific manner, by planting a hit under Nosworthy’s
ear, so powerfully, that he went
down in a twinkling. Nosworthy’s importance
was now all at an end; and two to one
was offered on Scroggins, without the least
hesitation.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—The game displayed by Nosworthy
was admirable, but he had received so plentifully
that his strength was somewhat reduced.
Another terrific rally occurred, in
which the superiority of Scroggins was manifest.
He never left his adversary till he
went down. (Three to one on Scroggins.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Nosworthy fought like a man, but the
chance was decidedly against him. Scroggins
had it all his own way in this round,
and planted his hits with all the success of a
first-rate fighter.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Upon setting-to, Scroggins, with much
severity, floored his antagonist.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Nosworthy, notwithstanding the punishment
he had sustained, came to the scratch
full of pluck, and made a desperate effort to
effect a change in his favour. He with much
dexterity put in a tremendous blow upon one
of Scroggins’s eye-lids; but the latter returned
upon him severely, and had the best
of the round.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The head of Nosworthy seemed an
easy mark for Scroggins, who peppered it
with the utmost sang-froid. The baker was
again floored.</p>

<p class='c022'>9 to 15 and last.—The courage of Nosworthy
was the admiration of the ring; he
continued to fight till not a shadow of chance
remained. He was so severely beaten in the
fifteenth round, that, on time being called,
he was unable to quit the knee of his second.
The battle was over in eighteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this triumph Scroggins rose rapidly in the esteem of the best patrons
of the ring, and was considered one of the best “little men” of the day.
Scroggins was scarcely known up to this time to the scientific circles, and his
rambling mode of fighting, so peculiar to himself, was rather the subject of
mirth than serious discussion; still it was thought, in some instances, that
he exhibited the prominent traits of the once terrific Hooper, a method that
would not be denied from boring in, and, when once in, must triumph from its
close and heavy half-arm deliveries, except in very rare instances. Although
Nosworthy was defeated, it was viewed as a determined and skilful battle on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>his side. The springing hits of Scroggins were truly tremendous; and covering
his head with his left hand, not only prevented him from receiving much
punishment at going in, but gave him additional vigour in “smashing” his
adversary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scroggins, it was urged, had offended several of his patrons, in consequence
of his insisting on the whole of the battle-money of the late fight
being given to him; and many of them felt determined, if possible, to select
a scientific boxer who should take the fight out of our hero. Bill Eales was
therefore chosen, and backed for this special purpose; but the knowing ones
were much divided in opinion respecting their merits. Two of the most
complete adepts in the ring took them under their care and training. The
sporting knowledge of Gully rendered him at all times, in the ring or on the
turf, no mean judge how to select his object, or to lay out his money; and
Tom Belcher’s experience had taught him too well to know the value of
success to give half a chance away: therefore when Gully selected Scroggins
as his favourite, and Belcher preferred Eales as the most competent pugilist,
it might not be inaptly observed that, “when Greek joins Greek, then comes
the tug of war!” The backers, as well as boxers, it was certain, meant to
win if possible. Eales was remarkable for his complete knowledge of the
tactics of the milling art, and possessed the important advantages of height
and length; while Scroggins was a nondescript, who disdained copying the
mode of any pugilist, and fought after his own method, if method it could be
termed.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Saturday, August 26, 1815, near the George, at Kingston Hill, contiguous
to Coombe Warren, this interesting and singular match was decided.
At an early period in the morning the various roads leading to the scene of
action were crowded beyond description. All sorts of vehicles were so close
upon each other as to defy enumeration, and pedestrians were numerous
beyond precedent. A great many high personages mustered on the turf,
among whom Earl Yarmouth, Lord Fife, the Hon. Berkeley Craven, etc.,
were observed. A few minutes before one the men entered the ring, attended
by their seconds. Tom Belcher and Harmer for Eales, Joe Ward and Oliver
for Scroggins. The spectators were struck with the great contrast between
the size of the combatants. Joe Ward tied the colours of the sailor, “true
blue,” to the stakes, as a token of defiance; and Belcher knotted over it the
“yellow-man,” as the colours of Eales. Both men looked well and confident.
The ceremony of shaking hands being gone through, the set-to immediately
commenced.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—From the scientific pretensions
of Eales, it was generally expected the first
round would clearly evince his superiority
over his short and sturdy opponent. Scroggy,
however, with the heroism of a British tar,
boldly bore down to the assault. The display
of Eales, although more scientific than
effective, was much admired. Scroggins,
equally anxious to commence the fight
favourably, exhibited some degree of caution.
Eales let go once or twice, but beyond
effective distance; at length Scroggins put
in a well directed blow under the left ear of
his opponent, and, in closing, threw him.
(The odds looked rather queer, and Scroggins
was pronounced the favourite.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—This round was decisively in favour of
Scroggins, who exchanged blows with his
opponent in the most gallant style of courage,
till Eales was at length floored.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Both the combatants were now alive
to the interest of the scene in which they
were engaged. A good rally occurred, and
they returned and exchanged liberally; in
the rally Eales went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—This was altogether a severe round.
If Scroggins planted some severe blows,
Eales returned punishment with equal
courage. Strength was evidently on the
side of Scroggins, who appeared merely
getting into work; while Eales, on the contrary,
showed symptoms of weak constitution,
and fought till he again went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Eales, notwithstanding his superior
science, could not make that impression
upon his opponent which was expected by
his friends. He succeeded, it is true, in
dexterously putting in some heavy blows,
which the hardy tar was not a degree behind
hand in returning, keeping up a battering
rally, till his opponent went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—The strength of Eales did not keep
pace with his judgment; he, nevertheless,
evinced good pluck. This was a pantomimic
round; altogether a piece of harlequin and
clown antics all round the ring. Eales
exerted his best skill to obtain a favourable
turn, and a terrific rally ensued; but, in
closing, the singularity of Scroggins excited
roars of laughter. In throwing Eales he
went down, then rolled over and over from
his adversary till he rose upon his legs with
all the comicality of a merry-andrew. Eales
displayed weakness, and the odds were five
to one on Scroggins.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—The combatants soon fought their way
into a sharp rally, and the science of Eales
prevailed to a certain extent, till Scroggins
went down. (Applause.)</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—A little discretion seemed necessary
on both sides; some sparring occurred before
a hit was made. Scroggins bobbed his head
to avoid the threatened blows of his opponent,
but returned fighting hand over head.
The punishment was severe in this round,
but reciprocal; however, Scroggins went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—The combatants attacked each other
with the most determined resolution; anything
like stopping was out of the question,
till they both found themselves upon the
ground. Eales could not lay claim to any
advantage; neither had Scroggins the worst
of it.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Another equally desperate round followed,
and a tremendous rally took place.
The blows on both sides did great execution—punishment
without stopping was the
order of the day.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Eales, notwithstanding the exertion
of the last round, came to the scratch with
considerable spirit, and showed off in such
good style upon his opponent, that Scroggins
again dropped his nob to escape the intended
milling.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—The science of Eales was exhibited to
great advantage, and Scroggins’ upper works
seemed under the direction of a chancery
practitioner, till he was sent under the ropes.
The round was contested with much resolution
on both sides.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Eales again tried it on with some
success by planting three severe hits on the
nob of Scroggins; but the latter, determined
not to be deficient in this part of the practice,
liberally returned the favours which
had been bestowed, and concluded the round
by cross-buttocking his antagonist.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—The spectators now perceived that
Scroggins was too much for Eales, as the
strength of the latter was evidently on the
decline every round. Scroggins punished
Eales in all directions, and gave him three
heavy hits on his nob, stomach, and neck.
In closing, both down, but Scroggins fell
upon Eales with a plunge enough to send
the wind out of his body.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—The advantage of strength was completely
on the side of Scroggins, who came
up to the scratch smiling with confidence.
Eales, although weak, fought with much
spirit, and contested every inch of ground in
a sharp rally, till Scroggins again threw and
fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Eales endeavoured to gain time by
cautious sparring, but Scroggins fought his
way pell-mell into a sharp rally, and adopted
the same mode as in the two preceding
rounds, by tripping up his adversary, then
falling upon him, depriving Eales of what
little wind he had left.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—From the terrible heat of the sun,
and the severe punishment both the combatants
had experienced, it did not excite any
degree of surprise to see them both at the
scratch in an exhausted state. The little
hardy tar, who had so often braved the
changes of climate, seemed of the two least
affected by the scorching rays that now
poured so heavily upon their persons, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>commenced fighting with great spirit. In
closing, he peppered Eales considerably, and
then cross-buttocked him. From this severe
touch it was expected Eales would not be
able to meet his man again.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Eales, though much exhausted, again
opposed his man, but the chance was decidedly
against him; Scroggins threw him
as before. (Any odds, but no takers.)</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—The fight was nearly taken out of
Eales; he was at the mercy of his antagonist.
He was again thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Eales tottered to the scratch; but
Scroggins gave him another cross-buttock
as if a child had been opposed to his
strength.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—The strength of Eales was quite reduced
as to effective punishment; he, nevertheless,
evinced good bottom, and did more
than might have been expected from one so
nearly beaten. Scroggins laid himself open,
but Eales was too weak to turn it to account.
In falling, Scroggins went down on him.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—It was now a horse to a hen, and
Scroggins threw his man with apparent ease.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Eales, to the astonishment of the
spectators, once more appeared at the mark;
but it was all up with him, and, by way of a
quietus, Scroggins put in so tremendous a
hit under his right ear that he was floored
like a shot. He could not come again. The
battle lasted twenty-two minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Scroggins, in defeating a
scientific boxer like Eales, completely astonished
every amateur present. It was singular
to observe the severity of his blows,
and the punishment he administered to his
opponent, though a man four inches taller
than himself. Indeed our little hero was
confidence itself. He assured his friends
previous to the battle, that he would win it
and nothing else. As an in-fighter, Eales
had decidedly the best of his opponent; but
his distances were so incorrect at times in
out-fighting that numerous blows were
thrown away. Some of the partizans of
Eales attributed his loss to a severe hurt
received on the back part of his head, in
falling violently against the stakes; but the
general opinion was that he lacked stamina
to resist the finishing qualities of his antagonist.
Eales was the heavier man, weighing
eleven stone and half a pound. The bets
never varied from the commencement of the
fight; Scroggins was the favourite throughout.
It was altogether a sharp contest, but
a great deal of time was consumed in struggling
to obtain the advantage in throwing.
Notwithstanding the great superiority Eales
had in standing over his opponent, united
with his first-rate skill, he could not prevent
Scroggins from going in. The admirers
of science were much disappointed at the
defeat of Eales.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the success Scroggins had met with in his boxing career, and the
numerous patrons of the art who rallied round him, he was enabled to commence
publican. He accordingly opened the Waterman’s Arms, at Stangate,
Lambeth, for the entertainment of the sporting world. His house in summer
time was then pleasantly and attractively situated, commanding a view across
the Thames, a part of the venerable Abbey, and Westminster Hall, with the
old St. Stephen’s, and the Houses of Parliament, destroyed by fire in 1836.
The name of John Scroggins, in large letters, at the top of the premises,
might be seen from the other side of the river, operating as an inducement,
not only to sporting characters, but to many an old shipmate of the Argo to
call and give our hero a friendly turn. He did not want for company of
every description. Peers and costermongers all contributed to make the pot
boil; and, though Scroggy could not boast of the eloquence of a Cicero, yet
he never suffered any of his customers to depart without receiving a ready
answer. Life, in a variety of shapes, was to be seen under the roof of this
little caterer for the public. In another part of his dwelling, the “saloon”
was not the least importance in the picture. In ruder hands it was merely
a skittle ground, but, under the taste and judgment displayed by “Scroggy,”
it assumed a new and prominent feature. A gallery was now added to it, in
addition to its being boarded over for the accommodation of spectators, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>embellished with chandeliers. Every Tuesday night it was opened as a
school for the art of self-defence; and here this remnant of the Olympic
games was conducted with characteristic spirit to overflowing audiences.
Scroggins himself usually appeared as a first-rate actor, assisted by several
professionals, in most of these performances, to explain and render the art
attainable. Here many a novice was floored for his temerity, by way of
initiation, and as a sort of preparatory step to a better acquaintance with the
practice and use of the gloves. The “tip” for admission was upon a reasonable
scale, a single sixpence, and liquor to its estimated value was allowed.
The sporting dinners given by Scroggins were excellent; and the Waterman’s
Arms generally afforded amusement to those persons who were disposed to
take a peep at the fun and frolic there exhibited, under the management of
this comic hero of the ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four months had scarcely elapsed when Scroggins again made his appearance
in the prize-ring, but under very different circumstances. Having in
his last combat defeated one of the most scientific boxers of the day, he was
now called to enter the lists with a complete stranger, and a mere novice.
It appears that Whittaker, from Denbigh in Yorkshire, an oilman by trade,
had criticised the milling talents of Scroggins rather freely in company;
which criticism resulted in a battle between them. The sum contended
for was fifty guineas a side, and so much confidence did the Oilman feel
upon entering the ring with Scroggins (notwithstanding his name was a
sort of terror to pugilists in general), that he put down thirty-two guineas
of the stakes out of his own pocket. Scroggins viewed Whittaker with
so much indifference that he thought he had merely to take off his coat
and win the fight. On Tuesday, the 9th of January, 1816, the fistic heroes
met to decide this trial of skill at Moulsey Hurst. The Oilman was understood
to be a clever and determined boxer, and so much interest was excited
in the sporting circles that upwards of ten thousand persons witnessed the
battle. The odds were two to one upon Scroggins, who was seconded by
Oliver and Clark; Whittaker was attended by Cribb and Richmond. The
men shook hands, and at one o’clock the set-to commenced:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The amateurs expected more
of a smashing than a scientific fight; Scroggins
thought so little of his adversary, that
he went to work <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans ceremonie</span></i>, but hit short
with his left hand; the Oilman, in return,
planted a slight nobber. The combatants
fought their way into a rally, and some sharp
blows were exchanged, at the end of which
the claret was seen trickling down Whittaker’s
face (no variation in the betting).</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The Oilman seemed full of pluck and
eager for battle. Scroggins again hit short,
but Whittaker improved on the opening, and
made a sharp left-handed blow. Some
desperate milling occurred; no want of
spirit on either side. In closing much struggling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>took place, when the Oilman got away,
but was ultimately sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—This was altogether a well-fought
round. If the Oilman did not show superlative
science, he evinced qualities that convinced
the spectators he was not to be beaten
off hand. Scroggins attacked his adversary
with much determination, and Whittaker
showed equal resolution in a sharp rally, till
he went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Science was not the forte of the combatants;
downright milling was the order
of this round. Scroggins missed several
hits, and did not appear to such advantage
as was expected. The Oilman fought with
much steadiness and composure, and his left
hand, in some instances, was successful.
The men rattled in a close, when the Oilman,
with much dexterity, threw his adversary.
The odds nevertheless were still high
upon Scroggins.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—It was evident that Scroggins had
paid little attention to training; and, at this
early stage of the fight, his wind appeared
rather treacherous. The Oilman attacked
his adversary in good style, and had the
superiority of hitting. Scroggins slipped in
making a hit, but soon recovered himself
upon one knee, and with much force levelled
his man.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Both combatants on their mettle;
reciprocal fighting took place. The Oilman
proved himself a much better man than he
was thought to be. The odds fell to six to
four.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Scroggins came to the scratch much
distressed and out of wind. The Oilman
improved upon this circumstance and made
several telling blows, ultimately finishing
the round in his favour. (Applause.)</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Scroggins could not recover his wind;
and, to avoid receiving punishment, resorted
to some strange manœuvres to amuse his
adversary. Whittaker was not to be deluded,
and stuck to Scroggy hard and fast
till he was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Scroggins came up fresher, and attacked
his opponent with unshrinking courage.
A rally took place, which was desperately
contested; but finished to the
advantage of Scroggins, who darkened the
Oilman’s left peeper.</p>

<p class='c022'>10 and 11.—Both of these rounds were
fought with manliness and resolution. It
was plain Scroggins had considerable work
to get through before victory would crown
his efforts.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Whittaker seemed more conspicuous
for high game and wrestling capabilities
than a sound acquaintance with the principles
of the pugilistic art; he threw Scroggins
in great style.</p>

<p class='c022'>13 and 14.—Rather in favour of Scroggins.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Here the Oilman showed to much advantage.
He put in several blows, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>16 to 30.—Several trifling changes occurred
during these rounds; in one of which
Scroggins met with an accident in falling,
which might have terminated the battle;
but his fortitude as well as policy was so
great, that, notwithstanding the excruciating
pain he suffered, he did not even communicate
the circumstance to his second, but
fought on under considerable disadvantage.
From the numerous antics and manœuvres
he played off, he recovered himself in some
degree, and succeeded in damaging his opponent’s
remaining eye.</p>

<p class='c022'>31 to 49 and last.—It is unnecessary to
detail the whole of these rounds; suffice it
to observe the Oilman contested the whole
of them with resolution and true game. He
fought till without the power of directing
his blows. He resigned the contest with
reluctance; urging his not being reduced in
bodily strength. In fact, he was humanely
persuaded by Mr. Jackson and his friends,
to retire, as he had no chance whatever,
from his defective vision. In other respects
there is no doubt but he might have protracted
the battle.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>-Scroggins had nearly given
the chance away on this occasion by overweening
self-conceit, and the contempt with
which he viewed the pretensions of Whittaker.
The victory indeed was more owing
to his good fortune than to judgment. He
laughed at the idea of training to beat a
novice, and never left his home for a single
night. In consequence of this neglect, he
took an hour and sixteen minutes to beat
Whittaker, which, had he been in good condition,
it is presumed he might have accomplished
in half an hour. Scroggins (almost
too late) found out the fault he had committed
from neglect of training. It was a
fortunate moment for our hero when the
Oilman was taken from the ground. The
memorable defeat and ruin of Broughton
ought always to operate as a useful lesson to
all pugilists—more especially to conquerors—respecting
their preparatory conduct.
Scroggins had nearly fallen a victim to this
blind confidence. His fame was tottering
on a precipice. Scroggins too was extremely
incorrect in his distances, but neither of
the combatants fought upon the defensive.
Whittaker was evidently the better wrestler,
and Scroggy appeared more punished about
his nob than in any other battle. Had not
Scroggins succeeded in closing the remaining
peeper of Whittaker, the termination
might have been rather doubtful, as the
latter was not seriously disabled in body nor
distressed in wind. Though he retired from
the ring a defeated man, it is but common
justice to state that a gamer pugilist than
Whittaker never quitted the field. Thirty
pounds was collected on the ground by Mr.
Jackson, as a reward for the bravery the
loser had displayed. Notwithstanding the
latter resigned the contest, he still entertained
an opinion that Scroggins was not
the best man, and attributed the chance
going against him to his being a stranger to
the tactics of the prize-ring.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>From the rapid conquests he had obtained, Scroggins was at this period
the envy of the boxing circles. His house was numerously attended; he
was enjoying the fruits of peace and the reward of his victories; smoking
his pipe with ease and pleasure, and laid up as it were in ordinary, resting
from the fatigues of war. But peace was not the element in which Jack
was seen to advantage; therefore, out of numerous challenges offered to him,
he accepted one from a countryman of the name of Church, a native of Gloucester,
who, it seems, “had heard of battles,” and thirsting to obtain fighting
glory, had determined to lead “a dull inglorious life” no longer. He left
Gloucester for the avowed purpose of challenging our hero; and Colonel
(afterwards the Earl of) Berkeley, his patron, had so high an opinion of his
qualifications, that he backed him for 100 guineas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Church, it appears, had milled all the best men in Gloucestershire, was well
known as a staunch man, was taller than his adversary, and possessed a
hardy and erect frame. Upon the match being made he went into training
near Enfield; during which period he gave proof that he was capable of
performing no little in the milling way. Three countrymen called at the
house where he resided, and rudely challenged him to fight. Church,
shamefully careless about the engagement he was under, with more rashness
than judgment, accepted their offer; fortune favoured him, for in a very
short time, it was reported, he disposed of the whole three, and public
rumour ran that he was likely to turn out a troublesome customer for
Scroggins.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Tuesday, August 20th, 1816, the men met, and Moulsey Hurst was
once more the theatre of pugilistic display. Myriads of persons left the
metropolis, in all directions, to view the renowned Scroggins, among whom
were Lord Yarmouth, Colonel Berkeley, Captain Barclay, etc. Vehicles of
all descriptions, from the barouche and four to the scavenger’s mud-cart,
were in requisition at an early hour, to reach the destined spot; the blood-horse,
in all the pride of high breeding, was galloping by all, and the more
humble donkey and the spare nacker trotting and snorting along the road, to
be up in time. Pedestrians of all ranks formed a moving scene, and by
twelve o’clock many thousand persons crowded the Hurst. Church appeared
first, and threw his hat into the ring; Scroggins shortly following his
example. The former was seconded by Tom Belcher and Bill Gibbons, the
latter by Cribb and Clark. At a quarter past one the men shook hands.
Three to one on Scroggins. The battle lasted fifty-eight minutes, and fifty
rounds took place, as follow:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Scroggins, on setting-to, seemed
anxious to be at work, but hit short. He,
however, soon made up for this deficiency
by giving his opponent two desperate facers,
which produced the claret in a twinkling.
Church seemed electrified by the severity of
his hits, exchanged a few blows, turned
round in confusion, and was ultimately sent
down. (Three to one on Scroggins.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Church appeared at the scratch bleeding.
Scroggins set-to determinedly, and
soon showed his opponent the severe punishment
he was likely to encounter, by putting
in two severe blows, right and left, on his
nob. Church again turned round confusedly,
but drew the cork of his antagonist. Scroggins
evinced his superiority, and finished
this round decidedly in his favour, by sending
his man down. In this early stage of
the fight, the spectators made up their minds
to the ultimate event, and four to one was
offered.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Church did not know what to do with
his antagonist; he was quickly sent down by
Scroggins, who held up both his hands.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—The position of Church was good, but
there was nothing of the scientific boxer
about him; nevertheless, he put in some
good hits, and, in closing, both went down.
Scroggins rolled over like a tumbler.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—This was rather a severe round, and,
in closing, Church endeavoured to fib his
opponent; both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Scroggins went furiously in to mill his
opponent, which he did most effectually, and
sent Church down. Both their mugs began
to show the effects of punishment.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Scroggins seemed determined to finish
his opponent, but twice hit short: he rushed
in and took great liberties with his nob.
Church again went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Church appeared to have no notion of
protecting his head from the attacks of his
opponent. He not only received two desperate
facers, but was punished severely at the
ropes, and milled down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—In this round Scroggins had it all his
own way; he hit Church quite out of the
ring. (Great applause.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Some good exchanges. In closing,
both down, Church undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Church broke away from a close, and
got into a rally, but he was at length sent to
the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—In favour of Church; he put in two
good blows, but, in closing, both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Scroggins hit him quite round against
the ropes, and Church was sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Scroggins put in a facer, and Church
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Church made a hit and fell down.
(Nineteen minutes.)</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Scroggins put in two facers, turned
suddenly round with all the agility of a
dancing master, and ended by flooring
Church.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Scroggins broke from a close, and
exchanged some blows; but Church ultimately
threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Church made one or two good stops,
but was sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Scroggins milled his opponent in all
directions without receiving any return, till
Church went off his legs.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—Scroggins was the principal receiver
in this round. In a close, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Scroggins, with the utmost <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>,
on setting-to floored his man, and stood over
him with the utmost contempt.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—Scroggins measured his distance
again well, put in a tremendous facer, and
ultimately threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Church felt for Scroggins’ nob twice,
and threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Scroggins received a hit at going in,
but, in closing, both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Church put in a facer, but Scroggins
soon floored him.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—Church, with much severity, hit his
opponent quite away from him, and had the
best of the round. In closing, both went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—Church seemed in this round totally
off his guard. Scroggins put in seven severe
facers in rapid succession, till he sent Church
down. (Twenty to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—Scroggins determined to lose no time,
pursued his advantage with the utmost spirit,
dealing out punishment at every step. His
rush was not to be resisted, and Church
again went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—Church gave his opponent a check
upon his nob as he was going in, but it did
not ultimately prevent Scroggins from boring
him to the ropes, and getting him down.
(Any odds.)</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—Church was completely on the taking
system; the knowledge of giving he seemed
totally ignorant of. A greater glutton was
never seen, no common caterer could serve
his inordinate appetite. Scroggins hit his
adversary off his legs.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—Church only appeared as a mark to
hit at. Stopping his adversary was out of
the question; he again measured his length
on the grass.</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—Scroggins was truly conspicuous in
this round. He did as he liked with his
antagonist, till he sent him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—It was astonishing to see Church,
considering the severe milling he had received,
continue to face his man with such
confidence. Ho had no chance whatever,
except being knocked down.</p>

<p class='c022'>34.—Church exchanged some blows in this
round rather to his advantage, but almost
laid himself down from exhaustion at the
conclusion of it.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>35.—Scroggins, in making a hit, literally
pushed down his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>36.—Church was hit down almost upon
setting-to.</p>

<p class='c022'>37.—Scroggins, eager to put a finishing
stroke to this game article, rushed in furiously
and sent him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>38.—Church’s face looked deplorable; he
received three tremendous blows. Scroggins
put in also a severe body blow with his left
hand, when Church as usual went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>39.—The battle might be said to be at an
end, but Church’s game was not yet exhausted.
Scroggins again sent his man
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>40.—Scroggins ran in to his adversary like
a bull, head foremost, at his body, and
caught hold of the waistband of his breeches,
but instantly recollecting, as it were, that he
had committed an error, he slid his hands
upwards. It might have been accidental,
but the seconds of Church considering such
an attack contrary to the established rules of
fighting, thought that to fulfil their duty
they ought to take their man out of the ring.
The umpires, however, passed it over, and
thus, fortunately for Scroggins, saved him
from the disagreeable circumstance of a
wrangle, or perhaps making a drawn battle
of it.</p>

<p class='c022'>41.—Though Church could not win, yet he
now and then felt for his antagonist’s nob
sharply, and in this round he put in a severe
facer, but Scroggins sent him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>42.—Nothing. Church went down upon
setting-to.</p>

<p class='c022'>43.—Scroggins again nobbed his opponent,
and, to add to the severity of the punishment,
Church received a severe body blow
before he found his way to the grass.</p>

<p class='c022'>44.—Scroggins hit his adversary cleanly
down, and it was apprehended that he would
not be able to come again; indeed, his backer
wished him to desist from the contest. The
seconds of Scroggins took the hint, and threw
up their hats in the air as the token of victory.
The outer ring immediately gave way,
but Church insisted upon fighting longer, and
the</p>

<p class='c022'>45th round commenced during this confusion.
The spirit of Church was good, but
his strength could not keep pace with his
wishes. Scroggins was awake that victory
was certain, and sent his adversary down in
quick time.</p>

<p class='c022'>46.—Church was now going very fast, and
was sent down upon setting-to.</p>

<p class='c022'>47.—The mortification of surrender urged
Church to continue the battle while he was
able to stand upon his legs; but it was all
up, and he was only receiving unnecessary
punishment, being sent down every round.</p>

<p class='c022'>48.—Church went down completely exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>49.—Notwithstanding the reduced state of
Church, he made a couple of hits, but it was
only to be sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>50 and last.—On coming to the scratch he
was floored, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans ceremonie</span></i>, and not able to
meet his man any more. He was led out of
the ring dreadfully beaten.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—A gamer man never entered
the ring than Church; he proved himself a
complete taker, but as to the winning consequences
of giving he had much to learn.
Scroggins was completely at home; cautious
of himself, his judgment was excellent in
perceiving when his antagonist was exhausted,
and going in promptly to finish him
off. He, however, gave a chance away, by
running head foremost at his opponent’s
body, a proceeding which at the present day
would have lost him the battle. Scroggins,
however, did not win this fight without considerable
punishment about the nob, one of
his eyes being nearly closed, and his face
much beaten. He never exhibited anything
like such marks before. Church sprained
his ankle severely in the third round; and
had not this accident occurred, he might
have stood up much better, perhaps with
more chance of ultimate success. His confidence
never deserted him throughout the
battle; and he talked to his second between
every round of his capabilities to continue
the contest. After the great success of
Scroggins in the two first rounds, when he
in fact reduced winning almost to a certainty,
many of the fancy expressed some
little astonishment that fifty-eight minutes
should elapse before Scroggins was able to
send his man out of the ring. Mr. Jackson
collected £20 to reward the bravery of
Church.</p>

<p class='c013'>The friends of Tom Hall (known as the Isle of Wight Hall), were extremely
anxious to match him with Scroggins for 200 guineas a-side; but,
after four meetings upon the subject, the last of which was held at the
Mansion House Coffee House, February, 1817, the partizans of Hall offered
to pay half the deposit between Scroggins and Turner, in order to induce the
former to relinquish that match. Hall also proposed to add ten pounds
which had been forfeited to him in a previous instance, to the battle-money;
but the offers were declined. Scroggins had no objection to fight Hall,
provided he weighed no more than eleven stone. However, it was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>general opinion among the best judges of pugilism that Hall was too heavy
for our hero.</p>

<p class='c007'>After six months’ interval, Scroggins again entered the prize ring. His
antagonist on this occasion was the afterwards celebrated Ned Turner. The
affair came off in a field near Hayes Turnpike, Middlesex, on Wednesday,
March 26, 1817; Scroggins fighting Turner £100 against £50. This contest
ended in a draw, the particulars of which will be found in the memoir of
Ned Turner, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 374.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second match was afterwards made on the 10th of June, 1817, Scroggins
fighting Turner £120 against £80.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon a review of the merits of the drawn battle above mentioned, some
doubts appeared to exist in the minds of the backers of Scroggins respecting
the result of the coming fight. The following contest, however, which took
place <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad interim</span></i>, not only tended to remove the doubts in question, but
operated so strongly towards increasing their former confidence in Scroggins
as to raise the odds to three to one that he was the victor.</p>

<p class='c007'>A meeting was held at Tom Oliver’s house in Peter Street, Westminster,
on Friday, May 2, 1817, to complete the stakes for the match between Sutton
and Ned Painter. Several pugilists were present upon this occasion, among
whom were Scroggins, Carter, West Country Dick, Ballard, Purcell, etc.
Scroggy having drank freely during the evening above stairs, descended into
the parlour and ridiculed Dick upon his defeat by Randall. He also offered
to bet two to one upon himself against Turner, which was immediately
accepted by Richmond; and, upon the latter’s taking up the money to deposit
in some person’s hands, Scroggins seized hold of the man of colour. Scroggins
now gave some ludicrous imitations of Richmond’s mode of milling,
calling him everything but a good one, and offered to fight the man of colour
in the room for any sum. The latter was much pressed to give Scroggins a
thrashing for his improper conduct, but Richmond kept his temper, although
called a cur for suffering such a little fellow to insult and triumph over him.
Richmond was not to be moved from his resolution, and very properly observed,
“That as Scroggins was under an engagement to fight Turner, the
sporting world should not experience a disappointment from his disabling the
man from fulfilling his agreement.” This conduct on the part of Richmond
was admitted to be handsome and manly by all present. Scroggins, however,
would not be denied—fight he would with somebody, and to accommodate his
penchant, a match was proposed between him and young Fisher for twenty
guineas a-side, to be decided instantly, the latter having gallantly beaten
the rough and hardy Crockey, before the Grand Duke of Russia, at Coombe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>Warren. Previously, however, the opinion of Mr. Jackson was taken respecting
the propriety of Scroggins fighting, considering his engagement with
Turner. Mr. J. thought he ought not. Scroggins overruled this objection,
by declaring that nothing should hinder him from having a mill, provided
Mr. Farmer would make the match. Shelton, in conjunction with some
other persons, then put down the money for Fisher. The large room at the
back of the premises was lighted up, the scratch made, bottles, lemons, etc.,
produced; the spectators retired to each end of the room, and the door was
locked. Mr. Jackson acted as umpire. Carter and Clark attended Scroggins;
Richmond and a novice waited upon Fisher. Three to two on Scroggins.
The parties shook hands—half minute time was allowed, and sixteen minutes
before twelve o’clock at night the battle commenced. More spirited betting
or greater order never was observed at Moulsey, Shepperton, or Coombe
Wood.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On setting-to mischief being
meant, little science was displayed between
the combatants; Fisher put in a slight body
hit. Scroggins reeled in after his usual
mode, and both went to work slap bang—some
sharp nobbers were exchanged, and,
in closing, both down, Scroggy undermost.
(“Well done, Fisher!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Fisher, full of gaiety, again hit, first
on the body, and seemed resolutely determined
upon following up his success. They
both nobbed each other smartly; and in
struggling to obtain the throw, Scroggy, as
before, was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Scroggins, from the effects of lushing,
came quite noisy to the scratch, and laughing
at Fisher, told him if he could hit no
harder than he had done, he must lose it,
and he (Scroggins) would soon convince him
of that fact. Fisher, not dismayed by this
threat, not only fought with his opponent
manfully, but threw him completely on his
face. (“Go it, Fisher!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—This was a good round, and Fisher
pelted away so sharply, that Scroggy seemed
rather sobered by the contact. Ceremony
was out of the question, hit for hit was reciprocally
given, till Fisher slipped and went
down. (Two to one on Scroggy was vociferated
by his partisans.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Fisher came to the scratch in the
most lively style, and set-to with as much
coolness as if he had been fighting a mere
commoner. They soon closed, Fisher undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Nothing but milling was the order of
this round; both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Scroggins rushed at his opponent with
the impetuosity of a bull-dog, and made his
one-two tell upon Fisher’s mug: the latter
stood to him like bricks, and contended
gamely till he found himself undermost in
the throw. (This change on the part of
Scroggy brought offers forward of four to
one in his favour.)</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Fisher went to work manfully, and
Scroggins slipped down from a hit, but,
instantly recovering himself, instead of
finishing the round, he rushed at Fisher,
when some sharp blows were exchanged till
both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Fisher with the utmost ease sent
Scroggy down. (“Bravo, Fisher—stick to
him, my lad!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—One of Scroggins’s peepers seemed a
little damaged, but his canvas appeared so
impenetrable that the claret scorned to make
its appearance. Both again down; but
Scroggins, while on the knee of his second,
gave two or three loud hems, as if to improve
his wind.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—This was a truly punishing round.
Fisher hit Scroggins slightly down—he was
up again in a twinkling, and most furiously
went in to mill his opponent; he was, however,
ultimately sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Fisher put in a good facer; but, in
closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—As yet, nothing was the matter with
Fisher, and considering Scroggins was three
parts groggy upon commencing the fight, he
convinced those around him what a fine
constitution he possessed. Fisher was also
viewed with admiration—and making allowance
for his “greenness” in contending with
a pugilist at the top of the tree, he proved
himself an ugly customer for this modern
Dutch Sam. in this round Fisher had the
best decidedly.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Scroggins went down in closing, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>the advantage was on his side. When on
his second’s knee, he sneeringly observed to
Fisher, that “he could not hit hard enough;
he had better give it in, as a few more of <em>his</em>
hits must finish him.”</p>

<p class='c022'>15 to 17.—Nothing material on either
side.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—In this round Scroggy was floored.
Great applause to Fisher.</p>

<p class='c022'>19 to 23.—Though Scroggins was the favourite,
yet many present considered the
event at this stage of the fight doubtful.
(Upon several offers being made, Scroggy
observed, “Aye, bet away, gentlemen, I can
win it like fun. I lay two to one on myself.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>24 to 29.—Fisher appeared still fresh, and
notwithstanding the desperate rushing forward
of Scroggins to take the fight out of
him, he never flinched from his man, but
fought with Scroggins like a game-cock. At
the conclusion of this round, which was in
favour of the cove of Stangate, he exclaimed
with the utmost confidence, “Who can beat
me, alive? I can mill any of ’em!”</p>

<p class='c022'>30 to 32.—Scroggins had the worst of
these rounds. He appeared rather distressed,
and from the effects of the grog
reeled about. Fisher exchanged many blows
to his advantage.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—This round was complete hammering.
Scroggins wanted to put an end to the
fight, and fought his way in with all the
determination of a lion. His blows were
terrific—and although he went down from a
sharp hit, he instantly jumped up again and
milled Fisher furiously till he got him down.
Carter now offered a guinea to half-a-crown.
“Bravo, Scroggy—he is an astonishing fellow!”
was the general cry.</p>

<p class='c022'>34 to 36.—Well contested on both sides:
but in the latter round Fisher missed putting
in a blow, that might have materially turned
the fight in his favour. He had hit Scroggins
away from him twice, near the corner
of the room, that laid him open, and instead
of following up the chance, he retreated
and got sent down. Scroggins again loudly
hemmed, upon his second’s knee, for wind.</p>

<p class='c022'>37.—Scroggins sent down Fisher in a
twinkling. This blow was on the face, and
from its tremendous severity, his countenance
changed. Scroggins shouted with glee,
and offered to bet anything.</p>

<p class='c022'>38.—Fisher again went down from a slight
hit. Scroggins, with much contempt and
confidence, “What do you think of that?
I’ll bet a hundred to one, I’ll win it.”</p>

<p class='c022'>39 to 42.—Fisher fought manfully, but a
change had taken place; he showed signs
of weakness, and went down in all these
rounds. (£250 to £100 on Scroggy, and his
partisans roared with delight.)</p>

<p class='c022'>43.—Scroggins now began to finish in high
style, and dealt out some tremendous punishment.
(Guinea to a shilling was offered, but
not taken.)</p>

<p class='c022'>44 and last.—Fisher came to the scratch
much distressed, and Scroggins again milled
him down. On time being called, Fisher
could not rise from his second’s knee, being
very faint and rather sick, upon which Scroggins
was declared the conqueror. The battle
lasted forty-one minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Fisher must be pronounced a
good man, and had he fought more at the
head he might have been able to have given
a better account of the battle. His mug
was a little battered, but in other respects
he did not exhibit severe marks of punishment.
He attributed his loss to the very
heavy falls he experienced more than to the
blows he encountered, and walked from the
scene of action without any help. Scroggins
fought under disadvantage; but the confidence
he possessed was truly astonishing.
He urged that he could beat all the light
weights, and entertained an idea that six
men in the whole kingdom did not exist who
could conquer him. He was much inebriated,
and the danger he was likely to experience
by losing a chance in his ensuing
fight with Turner, seemed not in the least to
operate on his mind. Though the above
conquest was not an easy fight, he was as
anxious to bet upon himself as the most
interested looker-on, offering terms almost
on every round. He was more beaten about
the face than his antagonist.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now decidedly two to one, and in many instances the odds were
still higher throughout the sporting, that Scroggins would add another laurel
to his wreath, in his second combat with Turner, on the 10th of June, 1817,
at Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, but the smiles of fortune abandoned
our hero, and, for the first time in his life, he found himself in defeat.
(See p. 377.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The only consolation Scroggins experienced, after his mind had overcome
the shock was attributing his loss to an accidental blow he received upon the
throat in the third round, and which swelled so rapidly as almost to deprive
him of the power of breathing; nothing could satisfy his wounded feelings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>but another opportunity to retrieve his lost laurels. Turner, without hesitation,
agreed to accommodate him, and Scroggins was so confident of victory,
that he put down the principal part of the money himself, to make the stakes
£150 a-side, the combat to take place on Tuesday, October 7, 1817. But
the charm was broken—the invincibility of Scroggins, in the sporting world,
was at an end—no longer a winning man his defects were too prominent to
be overlooked. A material falling off was observed at his benefit and he was
altogether so much reduced that the odds on the third contest were seven to
four against him.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the time allowed for training, Scroggins, as on a former instance,
unmindful of the necessity of paying attention to his health, in an inebriated
moment had an accidental turn up with Bob Gregson at Belcher’s. In this
skirmish he went down, and sprained one of his legs so severely that he did
not recover from its effects for upwards of a month; but, to make amends for
this indiscretion, so much did he fancy this match, that he sold his house,
quitted the character of a publican, and became a private individual, “in
order,” as he observed, “to be more able to keep to his training.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His third battle with Turner was fought at Shepperton October 7, 1818
(which, as well as the former, will be found under the Memoir of <span class='sc'>Turner</span>,
p. 382). Notwithstanding his professed contempt for regular training,
Scroggins appeared in the ring in better condition than his opponent. It
was evident to every one present that Scroggy strained every point to win;
and it is but common justice to remark, that his character as a boxer rose
higher, in every point of view, on that day than in any of his previous
battles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Poor Scroggy’s course was now a downward one. He had survived his
fame; and, never heeding the cautions of prudence, he paid the penalty,
which men in every profession, pugilism by no means excepted, must pay
for disregarding her dictates.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was successively defeated by Jack Martin, the opponent of Randall,
(see p. 398), at Moulsey, on the 18th of December, 1818, after a game fight
of sixty-five rounds, in two hours and two minutes; by Josh. Hudson, at
the same place, August 24, 1819, in eleven rounds, occupying eighteen
minutes; and twice by David Hudson, the first time in May, the second in
July, 1820.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scroggy, however, was still game, and ready for anything. Determined
as he himself said, “to lick somebody afore the year was out, pervising
he could get backers,” Jack looked in on the 30th of November, 1820, at
a “spread” given at Randall’s in Chancery Lane, by sundry patrons of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>fistic art. Spring, Purcell, Randall, Turner, Martin, Phil. Sampson, Harry
Holt, and others, were among the guests, and the patter turned on battles
past and matches to come. A swell observed, that “if he could be got into
condition, he should like to see a mill between Holt and the Old Tar, on
account of the contrast of their styles.” Holt expressed his approbation of
the proposal, and six weeks was mooted as the period. Jack, always rough
and ready, replied, “Why, as to that there matter, ’tain’t no match between
me and Holt; I can lick him like a babby. I never was so ill with a cold
in all my born days; but as to time, why I’ll fight him any time you like,
even now, bad as I am.” Holt returned Scroggins thanks for his candour;
but, in return, thought Scroggins would have no chance; “however,” concluded
Cicero, “far be it from me to aggravate the gentlemanly sort of man’s
impatience: I too think, if it can be managed, there’s no time like time
present.” “I’m ready,” retorted Scroggins; “but the winner shall have
the whole of the purse.” “And I am agreeable,” replied Holt. Ten guineas
were quickly posted, and the usual preparations were made for the contest.
Turner and Martin seconded Scroggins; Purcell and Sampson were for Holt.
Spring was time-keeper. Five to four on Scroggins on one side of the room,
and five to four on Holt among the other party.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The attitude of Holt was
elegant, and he appeared also difficult to
be got at. Scroggins was not long in commencing
his favourite rush, and he bored
in upon his opponent till he absolutely
ran down Holt in the corner, and fell
upon him.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—This round was all fighting; and the
wisty-castors flew about till both went down,
but Holt undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The fine science of Holt here told;
and he planted two nobbers with his left
hand without any return. Scroggins, however,
went in upon the old tack when, after
some exchanges, Holt got him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—After some exchanges of blows upon
their nobs, the combatants closed, and Holt
weaved his opponent in the Randall style.
Scroggins got the throw, and Holt was
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The left hand of Holt told severely,
and Scroggins went away with the force of
the hits. Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Scroggins rushed in on Holt, but in
making a hit he missed his opponent, and
fell. He immediately got up, and said,
“Gentlemen, I beg your pardon; I could
not help it.”</p>

<p class='c022'>7 and 8.—Nothing else but fighting—giving
and taking without flinching, till
both went down. “Bravo!” from the
Pinks, “it’s an excellent fight. Both are
good men; and Jack’s as good as his
master.” Scroggins seemed rather touched
in the wind, and he gave a loud hem.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Holt, in this round, was everything.
He gave Scroggy three facers without any
return, and also hit him down. “Scroggy,
he’ll spoil your beautiful mug, if you don’t
take care.”</p>

<p class='c022'>10 and 11.—Two slashing rounds. In the
last, Scroggy went down from a slip. Ten
minutes had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Holt, after making a slight blow,
slipped down. Six to four on Holt.</p>

<p class='c022'>13 to 15.—The blows of Holt were not
effective enough to take the fight out of
Scroggins. It was hard milling in all these
rounds. Scroggins said to his seconds,
“Don’t water me so much; it’s all right;
I can’t lose it.”</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Holt’s left eye was rather damaged,
and the claret had made its appearance on
his mug. This was a tremendous round,
and Scroggins threw Holt; but he behaved
handsomely to his fallen opponent,—instead
of falling upon him, as he might have done,
he walked away. “Bravo; you are a good
little fellow.”</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—Scroggins’s nob was a little changed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>and he again received two facers. Scroggins
also went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—After an exchange of blows, Scroggins
laughingly observed to Holt, “If you
don’t hit harder, my boy, you can never win
it.” Both down.—Twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Sharp fighting; but Scroggins went
down. Here Randall took some brandy to
Holt, and gave him advice. “How many
seconds are there to be?” said an amateur.
“If there are forty it will make no odds,”
observed Scroggins.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—In this round, Scroggins received a
severe hit on his throat; two facers were
also added to it; but he would not be
denied, and scrambled his way in, till they
both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Scroggins now began to wink, and he
was as much distressed as an old, worn out,
broken winded post prad; he, however, got
Holt down.</p>

<p class='c022'>22 and 23.—“Go along, Harry, it’s all
your own; he’ll not come above two more
rounds.” The left hand of Holt did some
execution, and Scroggins had now the worst
of it.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—This was a tremendous round. Scroggins
went to work like a blacksmith hammering
at a forge, and bored Holt into a corner.
Hit for hit was exchanged, till they both
went down; but Holt was undermost, and
the back part of his head came in contact
with the window-seat. “It’s all up;” and
Martin offered fifteen to ten.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Holt was quite an altered man, and
he seemed stupefied from the effects of the
fall. The whole of the falls throughout the
fight were heavy indeed. When time was
called, Holt came to the scratch with great
difficulty. Scroggins down and undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—The science of Holt was much admired;
and, although terribly distressed, he
put in two facers before he went down.
“He’s nothing else but a game man,” from
all the swells.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—Holt got better, and Scroggins, in
going down, was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—It was not yet safe to Scroggins.
Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—This round was severely contested;
but the heavy fall Holt received shook him
all to pieces. Ten to five on Scroggins.</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—Holt was game to the last; he exerted
himself, and got Scroggins down.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—Scroggins was very much exhausted,
but the fight was not out of him, and he
came up first to the scratch. Both down.
Ten to three.</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—It was evident Holt could not win,
and he was sent down in an instant. Ten to
one.</p>

<p class='c022'>33 and last.—Holt was sent down, and his
second could scarcely get him on his knee.
When time was called, the Birmingham
Youth said he should not fight any more.
Scroggins immediately came up to Holt,
and said, “Harry, give us your hand; you
are a good fellow, and here’s a guinea for
you!” Great applause from the swells, and
“Jack, you shall lose nothing by your generosity
and feeling.”</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—For two men out of condition,
nay, both unwell, particularly Scroggins, it
was a much better fight than has frequently
been seen when boxers have been in regular
training. Scroggins had still some tremendous
points about him, and the old tar’s
rumbling, hardy mode of boring in, told
severely at close quarters. It was a gallant
battle on both sides; but the blows of Holt
were not hard enough to stop the rush of
Scroggins. The accident Holt received in
the twenty-fourth round perhaps lost him
the fight; he also complained of a sprained
thumb before he commenced the battle. In
a ring some of the amateurs thought Holt
might have stood a better chance. The
smiles of victory, which had not been familiar
to Scroggins in his last six battles,
seemed to give him new life. It was an
out-and-out concern altogether; and the
patrons of the science, manliness, and true
game had a treat.</p>

<p class='c013'>This flush of success was followed by another gleam of sunshine. Scroggins
found backers, and was pitted against Joe Parish, the Waterman, who
having beaten Davis, Harry Holt, and Lashbrook, was thought a promising
plant, in spite of his having fallen beneath the all-conquering arm of the
Nonpareil, Jack Randall. Banstead Downs, in Surrey, on Saturday, March
3, 1831, were the spot and time, and fifty guineas the sum; it was the
second fight on the above day. The rain was pouring down in torrents when
Scroggins appeared and threw his hat into the ring, attended by Randall and
Paddington Jones as his seconds. Parish showed soon afterwards, followed
by Spring and Harmer. Both men appeared in excellent condition. For
one hour and a quarter, the rival pugilists exerted themselves in the highest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>style of courage to obtain the victory. The changes were frequent indeed;
two to one on Scroggins—three to one on Parish—three to one again on
Scroggins—then other changes. In the fifty-second round, from the distressed
state of Parish, Randall threw up his hat, as it did not appear that
Parish would be again able to appear at the scratch. He, however, recovered,
and fought till the sixty-ninth round; but in the last three rounds,
it was a hundred pounds to a farthing in favour of Scroggins. The latter
behaved extremely well, was remarkably steady, and reminded the spectator
of his best days. He was, however, terribly punished. The greatest
anxiety prevailed among the old fanciers, who were more than friendly in
their good wishes towards their old favourite. In the second round, Scroggins
fell with his shoulder against one of the stakes (which circumstance was
not known to the spectators, and operated as a great drawback to his exertions).
Had not this accident happened, Scroggins thought he could have
won it in much less time. Parish was punished but little about the head;
yet he remained in a state of stupor a short time after the fight was over;
and Spring carried him in his arms out of the ring. Parish displayed a
great deal of game, and suffered very severely from heavy falls. If Parish
had gone in to fight first, he might have given a better account of the battle.
Spring this day convinced the amateurs he was entitled to their praise, not
only as a most attentive second, but as a most active one; and it would not
be doing common justice to the anxiety and exertions he displayed to make
“ould Jack” win, to pass them over without notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the Thursday after the above fight, at Josh. Hudson’s benefit, Parish
addressed the Court, observing, “that although he had been defeated by
Scroggins, he was not satisfied, and was ready to have another trial.”
Scroggins, in reply, said, “from the advice of his friends, he had not intended
to have fought any more; but as how he was too much of a gentleman
not to accommodate Mr. Parish, who was also a gentlemanly sort of
a man; so he would give him another trial.” A guinea a-side was deposited;
but on the arrival of the night to make the stakes good, Parish did
not make his appearance, and the guinea, of course, was forfeited.</p>

<p class='c007'>This sunshine, however, was evanescent, and the course of Scroggins’s
history tends henceforth downwards. In April, 1822, as related in the life
of <span class='sc'>Tom Belcher</span>, p. 165 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, the hardy hero came in contact with the
scientific Tom; on this occasion if Tom was stale Scroggy assuredly was but
a shadow of his former self, and he was moreover in that state of lush which
had now become almost habitual to him. Still, however, “ould Jack,” as he
was already called, haunted the ring at every mill of note, unable to quit the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>arena of his many triumphs. The milling “spirit strong within him,” was
shown on the 12th of June, 1822, at Moulsey Hurst. On that occasion the
fights between Ward and Acton, and Burke and Marshall, having gone off
unsatisfactorily to the patrons of boxing there and then present, a brace of
countrymen offered themselves for a purse, and had actually “peeled,” when
Scroggy roared out, “Gentlemen, as you’ve had but little fun to-day, suppose
I fight the Gipsy, that will produce sport?” Cooper instantly replied that
he was ready; and the extemporaneous mill quickly commenced. Scroggins
was seconded by Harry Harmer and Bill Eales; Abbot and Turner picked up
the Gipsy. In this battle the rash and hardy little Tar showed the folly of
entering the ring out of condition. He was full of oranges, ginger beer, and
heavy wet, taken as antidotes to the heat of the day, and as unfit to fight as
a stall-fed ox; nevertheless he came up to be set down for twenty-five
minutes, during which seventeen rounds were fought; Scroggins was at
length persuaded to leave off. He afterwards observed, “he could not
win, but he wasn’t half-licked.” This was our hero’s last appearance in
the P. R.</p>

<p class='c007'>Poor Scroggins now became a mere hanger-on of pothouses: a droll,
diverting vagabond, occasionally picking up a few shillings as a second, or
receiving precarious assistance from those who had known him in more
prosperous days. Among these Cribb was long his friend, and “wittles”
(for which Jack had an inordinate penchant, until brilliant Juniper utterly
destroyed his digestion) were often set before him from the larder of the
generous host of the Union Arms. Occasionally too, Jack would get in
office as a waiter at one or other of the Sporting Houses; but his invincible
love of liquor soon lost him these temporary asylums. The editor of <cite>Bell’s
Life in London</cite> (V. G. Dowling, Esq.), by frequent generous appeals, and
taking Jack’s name as the comic pseudonyme for innumerable admirable
burlesque poems on public affairs, political and pugilistic, kept the
once formidable pugilist, now the poor pothouse buffoon, from actual
starvation.</p>

<p class='c007'>May the example of John Palmer have its proper weight with every man
whose physical capabilities lead him to adopt pugilism as a profession; and
enforce the truth, that no constitution, however good, no strength, however
superior to that of ordinary men, no amount of courage no degree of determination,
can supply the want of caution, of attention to training, of prudence,
of moderation; in short, of steadiness of conduct and becoming behaviour
in and out of the ring. This is the deduction which every attentive
reader of this history cannot fail to draw from a perusal of the lives of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>most eminent boxers—that in the ring, as in every other pursuit, honesty of
purpose, self-denial, and sobriety are indispensable—at least while engaged
in struggles to attain distinction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scroggins departed this life on the 1st of November, 1836, in extreme
poverty, having not quite completed his 49th year.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite> of November 6, appeared a “monody” of great

<h3 class='c003'>APPENDIX TO PERIOD IV.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c016'>CAPTAIN ROBERT BARCLAY, ALLARDYCE OF URY.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c009'><sup>[164]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c013'>A History of Boxing without mention of Captain Barclay would be incomplete.
As a thoroughbred sportsman, who practised what he studied, and
achieved what he attempted, his name will be long preserved. Whether
following the hounds after fox or deer, labouring to improve the system of
agriculture, displaying his extraordinary feats of pedestrianism, exercising
his judgment in training men for foot races and pugilistic combats, or in his
encouragement of Highland sports and pastimes, Captain Barclay was always
foremost. His knowledge of the capabilities of the human frame was complete,
and his researches and practical experiments to ascertain the physical
powers of man would have reflected credit on our most enlightened and persevering
physiologists. The sporting pursuits of Captain Barclay were scientific,
and his plans so well matured that his judgment generally proved
successful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Robert Barclay, Allardyce of Ury, succeeded his father in the eighteenth
year of his age. He was born in August, 1779; and, at eight years of age,
was sent to England to receive his education. He remained four years at
Richmond School, and three years at Brixton Causeway. His academical
studies were completed at Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Captain’s favourite pursuits were, the art of agriculture as the serious
business of his life, and manly sports as his amusement. The improvement of
his estates occupied much of his attention, and, by pursuing the plan adopted
by his immediate predecessor, the value of his property was greatly augmented.
His love of athletic exercises was seconded by the strong conformation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>of his body and great muscular strength. His usual rate of travelling
on foot was six miles an hour, and to walk from twenty to thirty miles
before breakfast was a favourite amusement. His style of walking was to
bend forward the body, and throw its weight on the knees; his step short,
and his feet raised only a few inches from the ground. Any person trying
this plan will find his pace quickened, and he will walk with more ease to
himself, and be better able to endure the fatigue of a long journey than by
walking perfectly erect, which throws too much weight of the body on the
ankle joints. With sound sense Captain Barclay tells us he always wore
thick shoes and lambs’-wool stockings, to preserve the feet from injury, and
impart a lightness and activity when for a time a lighter shoe is adopted.
The Captain possessed uncommon strength in his arms. In April, 1806,
while in Suffolk with the 23rd regiment, he offered a bet of 1,000 guineas
that he would lift from the ground the weight of half a ton. He tried the
experiment, and lifted twenty-one half hundred weights. He afterwards,
with a straight arm, threw a half hundred weight the distance of eight yards,
and over his head the same weight a distance of five yards.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following list contains the most prominent public and private pedestrian
exploits performed by Captain Barclay.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Captain, when seventeen years of age, entered into a match with
a gentleman in London, in the month of August, 1796, to walk six miles
within an hour, fair toe and heel, for 100 guineas, which he accomplished on
the Croydon Road.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1798 he performed the distance of seventy miles in fourteen hours,
beating Fergusson, the celebrated walking clerk, by several miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>In December, 1799, he accomplished one hundred and fifty miles in two
days, having walked from Fenchurch Street in London, to Birmingham,
round by Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Captain walked sixty-four miles in twelve hours, including the time
for refreshment, in November, 1800, as a sort of preparatory trial to a match
of walking ninety miles in twenty-one hours and a half, for a bet of 500
guineas, with Mr. Fletcher, of Ballingshoe. In training, the Captain caught
cold and gave up the bet. In 1801 he renewed the above match for 2,000
guineas. He accomplished sixty-seven miles in thirteen hours, but, having
drank some brandy, he became instantly sick, and unable to proceed. He
consequently gave up the bet, and the umpire retired; but, after two hours’
rest, he was so far recovered that he had time enough left to have performed
his task.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN ROBERT BARCLAY (<span class='sc'>Allardyce of Ury</span>).<br /><br /><em>From a Miniature</em>, 1798. <em>Ætatis</em> 19.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>Captain Barclay felt so confident that he could walk ninety miles in
twenty-one hours and a half, that he again matched himself for 5,000
guineas. In his training to perform this feat he went one hundred and
ten miles in nineteen hours, notwithstanding it rained nearly the whole of
the time. This performance may be deemed the greatest on record, being at
the rate of upwards of one hundred and thirty-five miles in twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 10th of November, 1801, he started to perform the above match,
between York and Hull. The space of ground was a measured mile, and on
each side of the road a number of lamps were placed. The Captain was
dressed in a flannel shirt, flannel trowsers, and nightcap, lambs’-wool stockings,
and thick soled leather shoes. He proceeded till he had gone seventy
miles, scarcely varying in regularly performing each round of two miles in
twenty-five minutes and a half, taking refreshment at different periods. He
commenced at twelve o’clock at night, and performed the whole distance by
twenty-two minutes four seconds past eight o’clock on Tuesday evening,
being one hour, seven minutes, and fifty-six seconds within the specified
time. He could have continued for several hours longer if necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>In December the Captain did one hundred miles in nineteen hours, over
the worst road in the kingdom. Exclusive of stoppages, the distance was
performed in seventeen hours and a half, or at the rate of about five miles
and three-quarters each hour on the average.</p>

<p class='c007'>As an additional instance of the Captain’s strength, he performed a most
laborious undertaking, merely for his amusement, in August, 1808. Visiting
at Colonel Murray Farquharson’s house in Aberdeenshire, he went out at
five in the morning to enjoy the sport of grouse shooting, when he travelled
at least thirty miles. He returned to the Colonel’s house by five in the
afternoon, and after dinner set off for Ury, a distance of sixty miles, which
he walked in eleven hours, without stopping once to refresh. He attended
to his ordinary business at home, and in the afternoon walked to Laurencekirk,
sixteen miles, where he danced at a ball during the night, and returned
to Ury by seven in the morning. He did not yet return to bed, but occupied
the day in partridge shooting. He had thus travelled not less than one
hundred and thirty miles, supposing him to have gone only eight miles in
the course of the day’s shooting at home, and also danced at Laurencekirk,
without sleeping, or having been in bed for two nights and nearly three days.</p>

<p class='c007'>In October, 1808, Captain Barclay made a match with Mr. Webster,
a gentleman of great celebrity in the sporting world, by which Captain
Barclay engaged himself to go on foot a thousand miles in a thousand successive
hours, at the rate of a mile in each and every hour, for a bet of 1,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>guineas, to be performed at Newmarket Heath, and to start on the following
1st of June. In the intermediate time the Captain was in training by Mr.
Smith, of Owston, in Yorkshire. To enter into a detail of his matchless
performance would be tiresome; suffice to say, he started at twelve o’clock
at night on Thursday, the 1st of June, 1809, in good health and high spirits.
His dress from the commencement varied with the weather. Sometimes he
wore a flannel jacket, sometimes a loose great coat, with strong shoes, and two
pairs of coarse stockings, the outer pair boot stockings without feet, to keep
his legs dry. He walked in a sort of lounging gait, without any apparent
extraordinary exertion, scarcely raising his feet two inches above the ground.
During a great part of the time the weather was very rainy, but he felt no
inconvenience from it. Indeed, wet weather was favourable to his exertions,
as, during dry weather, he found it necessary to have a water-cart to go over
the ground to keep it cool, and prevent it becoming too hard. Towards the
conclusion of the performance, it was said, Captain Barclay suffered much
from a spasmodic affection of his legs, so that he could not walk a mile in
less than twenty minutes; he, however, ate and drank well, and bets were
two to one and five to two on his completing his journey within the time
prescribed. About eight days before he finished, the sinews of his right leg
became much better, and he continued to pursue his task in high spirits;
consequently bets were ten to one in his favour, in London, at Tattersall’s,
and other sporting circles.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Wednesday, July the 12th, Captain Barclay completed his arduous
undertaking. He had till four p.m. to finish his task, but he performed the
last mile by a quarter of an hour after three in perfect ease and great spirits,
amidst an immense crowd of spectators. The influx of company had so much
increased on Sunday, it was recommended that the ground should be roped
in. To this, however, Captain Barclay objected, saying he did not like such
parade. The crowd, however, became so great on Monday, and he had
experienced so much interruption, that he was prevailed upon to allow this
precaution to be taken. For the last two days he appeared in higher spirits,
and performed his last mile with apparently more ease and in a shorter time
than he had done for some days past.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the change of weather he had thrown off his loose great coat, which
he wore during the rainy period, and walked in a flannel jacket. He also
put on shoes thicker than any which he had used in any previous part of his
performance. When asked how he meant to act after he had finished his
feat, he said he should that night take a good sound sleep, but that he must
have himself awaked twice or thrice in the night to avoid the danger of a too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>sudden transition from almost constant exertion to a state of long repose.
One hundred guineas to one, and indeed any odds whatever, were offered on
Wednesday morning; but so strong was the confidence in his success that
no bets could be obtained. The multitude who resorted to the scene of
action in the course of the concluding days was unprecedented. Not a bed
could be procured on Tuesday night at Newmarket, Cambridge, Bury, or any
of the towns or villages in the vicinity, and every horse and vehicle were
engaged. Among the nobility and gentry who witnessed the conclusion of
this extraordinary performance were the Dukes of Argyle and St. Alban’s;
Earls Grosvenor, Besborough, and Jersey; Lords Foley, and Somerville;
Sir John Lade, Sir F. Standish, etc. The aggregate of the bets is supposed
to have amounted to £100,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Barclay, as noticed in our memoir of Cribb, gave his training
experience to the world in a modest publication. His papers upon agriculture
in various magazines published in England and Scotland, were remarkable
for their sound sense, plainness, and practical knowledge. That the
severity of his athletic feats did not prematurely wear out the animal machine
may be inferred from the fact that he enjoyed a green and active old age at
Ury, near Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, his patrimonial estate, until his 79th
year, respected as strongly in private circles for his kind and gentlemanly
demeanour as celebrated for his public exploits, sporting and athletic.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>GEORGE STEPHENSON, M.P.—1801.</h4>

<p class='c013'>It would indeed be the ignorance which casts away pearls were we to
pass unnoticed an illustration of manhood identified with the practice of
pugilism, wherein the honoured name of the greatest engineering genius of
an engineering age was the prime actor. George Stephenson, therefore, the
practical originator of the locomotive, the creator of railways as we now
see them, the constructor of the most complete, permanent, and stupendous
works on mainland, coast, and sea, that an age of wonders has seen,
finds a place in <span class='sc'>Pugilistica</span>. The facts and text of the narrative of this
episode in the early life of George Stephenson are from Smiles’s “Lives
of George and Robert Stephenson,” p. 80, edit. 1864. We may observe
that George Stephenson (born June 9, 1781) would be twenty years of
age in 1801.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>“Not long after Stephenson began to work as brakesman at Black
Callerton (near Newcastle), he had a quarrel with a pitman named Ned
Nelson, a roystering bully, who was the terror of the village. Nelson was a
great fighter, and it was therefore considered dangerous to quarrel with him.
Stephenson was so unfortunate as not to be able to please this pitman by the
way in which he landed him when drawing him out of the pit; and Nelson
swore at him grossly for the alleged clumsiness of his ‘brakeing.’ George
defended himself, and appealed to the testimony of his fellow-workmen.
But Nelson had not been accustomed to George’s style of self-assertion, and,
after a torrent of abuse, he threatened to kick the brakesman, who defied
him to do so. Nelson ended by challenging Stephenson to fight a pitched
battle. The latter coolly accepted the challenge, and a day was fixed on
which the fight was to come off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great was the excitement in Black Callerton when it was known that
Geordie Stephenson had accepted Nelson’s challenge. Everybody said Nelson
would ‘kill him.’ The villagers, the young men, and especially the boys of
the village, with whom George was a great favourite, all wished he might
beat Nelson, but they scarcely dared to say so. They came about him while
he was at work in the engine-house to inquire if it was really true that he
was going to fight Nelson? ‘Ay, ay; never fear for me, I’ll fight him,’
replied George coolly. And fight him he did. For some days previous to
the appointed day, Nelson went entirely off work for the purpose of training,
whereas Stephenson attended to his daily work as usual, for he was always
temperate and in good condition, and did not seem in the least disconcerted
by the prospect of the battle. So, on the day appointed George went into
the Dolly Field, where his already exulting opponent was ready to meet him.
George stripped, and went in like a practised pugilist, though it was his first
and his last pitched battle. After a few rounds, George’s wiry muscles,
sound wind, cool self-possession, and practised strength enabled him so
severely to punish his opponent as to secure an easy victory. This circumstance,”
concludes Mr. Smiles, “is related in illustration of Stephenson’s
pluck and courage; and it was thoroughly characteristic of the man. Yet
he was the very reverse of quarrelsome. But he would not be put down by
the bully of the colliery, and he fought him. There his pugilism ended.
They shook hands, and continued good friends. In after life Stephenson’s
mettle was hardly tried, but in a different way; and he did not fail to
exhibit the same resolute courage in contending with the bullies of the railway
world that he showed in his encounter with Ned Nelson, the ‘fighting
pitman,’ of Callerton.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>JOHN SHAW, THE LIFE-GUARDSMAN.<br /> ONE OF THE HEROES WHO FELL ON THE FIELD OF WATERLOO.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This stalwart soldier, whose martial exploits and honourable death are
recorded in the pages of Sir Walter Scott, Sir W. Napier, and the military
annals of his country, bade fair to become a bright star in the pugilistic
sphere, had not his career been so speedily terminated in the field of glory.</p>

<p class='c007'>John Shaw was a native of Woolaston, in Nottinghamshire, and brought
up as a farmer until eighteen years of age, when, tired of leading a dull,
inglorious life, he enlisted, on the 16th of October, 1807, as a private in the
Life-guards. Europe, we need hardly tell the reader, was then involved in
the flames of war by the martial spirit and aggressive designs of the French
nation and its military Emperor, and young Shaw—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Had heard of battles, and had long’d</div>
      <div class='line'>To follow to the field some warlike lord.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When Shaw was a mere stripling, during the time he was fighting with
a man three stone heavier than himself, at Woolaston, and in danger of being
defeated, Jem Belcher, who was at Nottingham, suddenly made his appearance
in the ring. That experienced hero went up to Shaw, and advised him
how to alter his tactics so as to secure success. Shaw, learning that it was
the renowned Jem Belcher who thus stepped forward to direct his efforts,
felt inspired with fresh courage, acted promptly on the advice given him,
and, in the course of a round or two, so turned the battle in his favour that
he ultimately gained the victory in great style, and earned the praise of Jem
Belcher. From this incident he attached himself to scientific pugilism.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shaw possessed, in an eminent degree, many requisites for a first-rate
pugilist. He was in height six feet and half an inch, weighing, when
stripped, close upon fifteen stone; and he derived great advantages from
repeated exercise with the dumb-bells, as a part of his military discipline; his
continual practice of the broadsword also gave increased strength and elasticity
to his wrists and shoulders. Discipline, too, had taught him coolness,
in addition to a most excellent natural temper. He was introduced to the
Fives Court under the patronage of Colonel Barton. In his first exhibitions
he was considered rather slow; but from the frequent use of the gloves, in
competition with the most experienced and scientific boxers, he rapidly
improved. His height, length, weight, and strength, united with a heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>which knew no fear, rendered Shaw a truly formidable antagonist. His
public displays were considered far above mediocrity, and he felt great pride
in getting the best of the then terrific Molineaux. In a trial set-to at Mr.
Jackson’s rooms with Captain Barclay—who never shrunk from punishment,
or hesitated in milling his adversary, scorning anything like the delicacy of
“light play,”—the latter received such a convincing blow, that a dentist was
called in to replace matters in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">statu quo</span></i>. The best critics were satisfied he
was a thorough-bred one, and it was proved to be very difficult to hit him
without being returned on. In retreating he made use of his left hand with
much effect, and was thought to fight something after the deliberate manner
of Cribb.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the neighbourhood of Portman Square our hero milled three big fellows
in the course of a few minutes with comparative ease, for insulting him on
the “stay at home” character of his regiment, at that time a favourite taunt
of the vulgar. They were compelled to acknowledge their misconduct, and
glad to cry for quarter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shaw’s first appearance in the P. R. was on Saturday, July 12, 1812, at
Coombe Warren, with Burrows, a sturdy West-countryman, who had fought
a good battle of an hour’s length with the tremendous Molineaux, when the
athletic powers of the latter hero were undebauched and in full vigour; but,
in the hands of Shaw, the West-countryman had not the slightest chance.
In the short space of seventeen minutes, in which thirteen rounds were
fought, the superior science of Shaw had so nobbed Burrows that he could
not see his way, and he was led out of the ring. Burrows never once drew
blood from Shaw, who quitted the field without a scratch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nearly three years elapsed before Shaw made a second appearance, during
which period, it seems, from the considerable practice he had with the
gloves, he was materially improved in science. On April 18, 1815, at
Hounslow Heath, for a purse of fifty guineas, he entered the lists with one
of the bravest of the brave, namely, Ned Painter. Victory again crowned
his efforts in twenty-eight minutes, and he retired from the contest little, if
any, the worse for wear. See <span class='sc'>Painter</span>, Vol. II., Chapter III., p. 77.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is certain Shaw had an eye upon the championship, for he now formally
challenged all England. The amateurs were divided in opinion, but Shaw
felt confident, in his own mind, that no boxer existed who could conquer
him. Six weeks had scarcely elapsed after the above battle, and no time
allowed for either Cribb or Oliver (who would not have suffered such a
challenge to pass over unnoticed) to have an opportunity of entering the
lists with Shaw to decide the point, when the Life-guards were ordered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>abroad, and Shaw soon found himself, with his comrades, on the plains of
Waterloo. His heroism on that memorable occasion has been handed down
to posterity in those glowing colours which real courage and love of country
merit. Sir Walter Scott has thus sung the fame of Shaw:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The work of Death is done, yet still her song</div>
      <div class='line'>In Britons’ praise the muse would fain prolong,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would, were her power but equal to her will,</div>
      <div class='line'>Swell to a mighty stream her slender rill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Exalt her voice to praise each gallant son,</div>
      <div class='line'>But chiefest thee, O godlike Wellington!</div>
      <div class='line'>But who can count the sands? then might he name</div>
      <div class='line'>The lengthen’d numbers of the sons of fame:</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor ‘mongst her humbler sons shall <span class='sc'>Shaw</span> e’er die,</div>
      <div class='line'>Immortal deeds defy mortality.</div>
      <div class='line'>Posterity shall read the glowing page</div>
      <div class='line'>That paints the glories of a former age,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then shall their bosoms burn with patriot fires,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, if their country calls, they’ll emulate their sires.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In “Paul’s Letters to his Kinsfolk,” Sir Walter, writing from Paris of
the Battle of Waterloo, observes:—“Amid the confusion presented by the
fiercest and closest cavalry fight which had ever been seen, many individuals
distinguished themselves by feats of personal strength and valour. Among
these should not be forgotten Shaw, a corporal of the Life-guards, well
known as a pugilistic champion, and equally formidable as a swordsman.
He is supposed to have slain or disabled ten Frenchmen with his own hand,
before he was killed by a musket or pistol shot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The “science of the sword” was possessed by Shaw in a superior degree,
which, backed by British strength and resolution, tended to secure the
fortune of the day, in reducing the confidence of Napoleon’s hitherto invincible
cuirassiers:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A desperate charge the cuirassiers oppose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thrust for thrust, and blows return for blows.</div>
      <div class='line'>But still in vain the British sabres fall,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose strokes rebounded from a brazen wall.</div>
      <div class='line'>At length more wary, with experience stor’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>They now apply the science of the sword:</div>
      <div class='line'>Just at the juncture of the arm and chest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where meet the mail-plates of the back and breast;</div>
      <div class='line'>In gentle curve, they leave an opening way,</div>
      <div class='line'>To fit the shape and give the shoulder play;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some watch the moment while the uplifted arm,</div>
      <div class='line'>Urg’d by a feint, protects the head from harm,</div>
      <div class='line'>To reach, with lightning speed, the unguarded part</div>

<p class='c007'>It appears, on the first day, previous to the Battle of Waterloo, Shaw was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>wounded in the breast, and was ordered by his commanding officer to remain
in the rear; but after the wound was dressed, and feeling little inconvenience
from it, he nobly disdained to shrink from the post of honour, and on the
18th took part in the grand decisive charge. After having performed his
duty towards his country in a giant-like manner, and exalting his character
as a man and a soldier, he fell on the 18th of June, 1815, covered with glory.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would appear, from the statement of the author of “Anecdotes of
Waterloo,” that Shaw, though prostrated by a pistol shot, was yet alive on
the morning of the 19th, but in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">articulo mortis</span></i>, having received an immense
number of lance-wounds after his fall from the French light-cavalry, armed
Polish fashion, who galloped over the ground. A soldier of the 73rd gave
the expiring hero a draught of water; but he was “past all surgery,” and
soon afterwards expired without the possibility of removal to hospital.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>GEORGE NICHOLLS, THE CONQUEROR OF CRIBB.</h4>

<p class='c013'>George Nicholls finds a niche here, principally from the circumstance of
his early victory over the renowned Tom Cribb; his other fistic exploits,
though numerous, not being of celebrity sufficient to entitle him to this
distinction. Nicholls was one of the numerous offshoots of the Bristol school,
and was born in that city in the year 1795. In the third volume of
“Boxiana” Pierce Egan has given an account of twenty-five pugilistic
engagements, but, like the exploits of heroes before Agamemnon, they find
no record, save in his pages. The most remarkable of those are thus narrated.</p>

<p class='c007'>At seventeen years of age George entered the ring with a man of the name
of Hocky Harding. It was only for a guinea a-side, and it took place on
Durdham Downs. Nicholls had for his seconds Applebee and George Davis.
In forty minutes Harding was defeated, and the punishment he received was
terrific. This latter boxer had gained considerable notoriety in having made
a drawn battle, after a desperate fight with the celebrated Bill Warr.</p>

<p>GEORGE NICHOLLS.<br /><br /><em>From a Drawing by</em> <span class='sc'>G. Sharples</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>A week after the above battle, the brother of Harding, anxious to have a
turn with Nicholls, fought him on Durdham Downs for a guinea and a half
a-side, but, in the second round, Harding, receiving an ugly knock, exclaimed,
“I’ve had enough; George shall not serve me as he did my brother.”
Applebee and Davis were also seconds to Nicholls on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sailor, who weighed thirteen stone, challenged Nicholls for a guinea
a-side. This battle took place in the Back Fields, near Lawford’s Gate.
The man of war was a troublesome customer, and did not give in till one
hour had expired.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bill Thomas, a butcher, of Chepstow, had so good an opinion of his milling
qualities, that he sent a public challenge to Bristol to fight the best man in
that city. Nicholls accepted the challenge without delay, and he also won
it off-hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leonard, the champion of Bath, was matched against Nicholls for five
guineas a-side. Bob Watson and Tom Davis acted as seconds to our hero.
This battle took place on Lansdown, the same day that Spaniard Harris and
Bill Cox fought. The Bath champion was dreadfully beaten, and both his
peepers were soon closed; while Nicholls received but a slight injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is stated by Pierce Egan that Nicholls was victor in forty-nine battles
out of fifty.</p>

<p class='c007'>We will now quit these dateless records of Nicholls’s triumphs over the
“illustrious obscure,” to come to his crowning achievement, the exploit
which has preserved his name. It has been repeatedly urged that this overthrow
occurred during the brave Tom’s noviciate; but he had previously
beaten that renowned pugilistic veteran, George Maddox, Tom Blake, and
Ikey Pig, all of them men of notoriety as pugilists. The success of these
contests had rendered Cribb somewhat conspicuous, and he was rising fast
into eminence and fame, when he entered the lists with Nicholls, for a subscription
purse of £25, at Blackwater, thirty-two miles from London, on
Saturday, July 20, 1805, made up by the amateurs, to compensate them
for being deprived of witnessing the intended fight between the Game
Chicken and Gully. Tom Jones waited upon Nicholls, and Dick Hall was
second to Cribb. The odds on setting-to were greatly on the side of Cribb,
who was the favourite; but Nicholls, aware of Cribb’s method of fighting,
fought him after the style of Big Ben in his contest with Tom Johnson.
Nicholls, like a skilful general, armed at all points, was not to be deluded by
the feints of the enemy. The system of milling on the retreat, which Cribb
had hitherto practised with so much success, in this instance failed. The
coolness and good temper of Nicholls appeared so eminently throughout the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>fight, that not only did he preserve his fortitude, but added vigour to his
judgment. Hence, both in attack and defence, the future champion found in
Nicholls a steady and decisive fighter. Cribb became perplexed at finding
his tactics foiled. The advantage he had derived in former contests by
drawing his opponents, and then punishing and irritating them in their
pursuit, so as to make them throw their blows out of distance, and consequently
render them feeble, ineffective, and uncertain, was rendered entirely
unavailing. George would not suffer Cribb to play round him, but, with a
guard like Ben’s, firm in the extreme, his attitude was impregnable. Nicholls
could never be induced to quit his position without putting in a tremendous
hit, waiting with the utmost skill for the attack of his opponent, and then
giving the counter with stinging severity. George scarcely ever failed in
breaking through the defence of his adversary, and ultimately concluded the
round with a knock-down blow. Nicholls was a tremendous hitter; and his
one, two, rendered him truly formidable. The science and ability displayed
by Nicholls in this contest completely astonished the sporting world, many
of whom, in obtaining such knowledge, found that they had procured it at
no trifling expense.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have not met with any good or detailed account of this remarkable
battle, and shall therefore add another report, which we find in “Pancratia,”
pp. 237‒238.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As so many amateurs had collected and come from town, a distance of
thirty-two miles, to be present at this famous match, they were determined
to knock up a fight, and Tom Cribb, the Black Diamond, who ranked very
high as a pugilist, was matched against a man of the name of Nicholls,
a Bristol man, and who, like Gully, had never fought on a London stage.
The former was seconded by Dick Hall, and the latter by Tom Jones. At
setting-to Cribb was the favourite, and odds were greatly in his favour. In
the first round Nicholls, however, brought him down; but this was thought
nothing of, as it was well known Cribb frequently threw himself back to
avoid a blow. In the fourth round Cribb put in a most severe blow, and cut
his opponent under the right eye. Nicholls still fought with great spirit,
and perfectly cool and good-tempered. By the end of the twentieth round
Nicholls had perfectly closed one of his antagonist’s eyes, notwithstanding he
fought with great dexterity, and made several good rallies. At the end of
the fortieth round Cribb appeared distressed in his wind; he, however, had
somewhat recovered the sight of his eye, but began to fight very shyly, and
shift: his blows were frequently short, and he several times fell back from
his own hits. At the end of the fifty-second round he gave in, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>knowing ones were done, as they were sanguine of Cribb, even to the last.
Nicholls was by all acknowledged a prime fellow: his superiority consisted
of very expertly breaking on his adversary, in the style of Slack, by projecting
his arm suddenly against his antagonist’s face when he swung forward to
put in a blow. It has been asserted in the public prints that Cribb never
has been unsuccessful throughout his pugilistic career; but this must be the
consequence of ignorance on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nicholls now retired from the ring, and, returning to his native city,
invested the money he had gained, and which had been somewhat augmented
by the subscriptions of several patrons of manly courage, in a butcher’s shop,
in Gloucester Lane, Bristol. Here he added another to the innumerable
contradictions to those maligners of pugilism, who would identify it with
ruffianism, by earning in a long life the character of a quiet, inoffensive, nay,
a retiring man. In fact, all who remember him describe him as “shunning
general company, rarely visiting a public house, and of a somewhat religious
turn of mind;” the leisure time his business afforded him being occupied in
angling, his favourite recreation. He died at his native place, June 6, 1832,
in the fifty-eighth year of his age.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>DAN DOGHERTY—1806‒1811.</h4>

<p class='c013'>As the name of Dogherty is continually found scattered up and down the
reports of ring affairs for many years, and also in the pages of “Pancratia”
and “Boxiana,” we shall devote a few paragraphs to a sketch of his ring
career, chiefly from the latter work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dogherty’s first set-to was early in June, 1806, with a Jew, at Wilsden
Green, where he proved the conqueror; and shortly afterwards, at the same
place, on the 17th, he easily beat one Wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Lowfield Common, near Crawley, Sussex, August 21, 1807, he conquered
Dick Hall; and on his return home that day had a turn-up in the
road with Jack Warr, whom he milled.</p>

<p class='c007'>George Cribb he defeated twice. See <span class='sc'>George Cribb</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Epsom Downs, Tom Belcher conquered Dogherty. See <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 156.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dogherty fought one Pentikin, a Scotch Baker, at Golder’s Green, Hendon,
June 11, 1808, for forty-five minutes, when Pentikin gave in. Dogherty
fought him forty guineas to twenty.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>At Moulsey Hurst, October 25, 1808, Dogherty fought with Jack Power
for an hour and a quarter. It has been considered rather a disputed point,
but Dogherty claimed it, and got the money. It should be remembered that
Power was but a mere strippling at that period.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Epsom Downs, February 1, 1809, Dogherty beat a turnpike man.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 18th of January, 1811, he met with a reverse of fortune in being
defeated by Silverthorne, at Coombe Wood, but he was then considered in
bad condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>In November, 1811, he beat with considerable ease, at Chichester, Ben
Burn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dogherty for a long time was engaged on a sparring excursion, not only in
various parts of the kingdom, but also in the sister country. On Tom
Belcher’s arrival in Ireland, the superior science of that pugilist having, it
is said, taken from Dogherty a number of his pupils, a battle took place
between them. On the 23rd of April, 1813, for 100 guineas, they decided
the contest on the Curragh of Kildare, when Dogherty again fell beneath the
conquering arm of Belcher. See <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 160. This great battle is omitted
from “Fistiana,” under Dogherty, though indexed under Belcher.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dogherty, from this period, remained in his native land, where he taught
sparring, and was known as a civil and active fellow: he was thus engaged
as late as 1827. Pierce Egan tells an anecdote of him which we preserve.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dogherty’s Duel.</span>—Notwithstanding Dan’s penchant for the arbitrement
of the fist, he accepted a challenge to fight with pistols, in order to place his
opponent upon equal terms, he, it was urged, having no pretensions to
boxing. It appears the meeting was a sort of hoax upon the combatants, as
planned by the friends of both parties. The seconds, unknown to Dogherty
and his opponent, merely put powder into the pistols. The adversary of
Dogherty fired first, when the latter, forgetful of the “honourable” situation
in which he stood, resorted to the scientific practice of the ring, by putting
up his right arm as a natural stop to prevent the ball hitting his face,
producing much fun to those who witnessed and contrived the duel.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>GEORGE CRIBB,<br /> BROTHER TO THE CHAMPION OF ENGLAND.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Cribb and victory have so often been coupled, that in attaching defeat to
the name we almost pause; but such is the case. While the champion,
Tom Cribb, enjoyed the smiles of victory, and the patronage annexed to it,
the junior hero, panting to emulate the heroic deeds of his warlike brother,
encountered nothing but defeat.</p>

<p class='c007'>George first entered the lists with Horton, near Bristol, for a purse of
50 guineas, on September 5, 1807, and notwithstanding the assistance of his
brother Tom for a second, was beaten in twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>On February 9, 1808, he was defeated by Dogherty on Highgate Common.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the coast, near Margate, August 9, 1809, he entered the ring with
Cropley, and was conquered in sixteen minutes. George did not let his
opponent win without punishing him a good deal. It was considered an
unequal match.</p>

<p class='c007'>At a meeting of amateurs, May 1, 1810, at Bob’s Chop-House, after a
sporting dinner, he again fought Dogherty, when Tom Cribb also seconded
his brother. In this contest George proved himself a game man, and at
times overcame the superior science of his adversary; but, at the end of an
hour, Dogherty was the conqueror, and had the £20 purse. It was a severe
battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>George fought with Isle of Wight Hall, on November 15, 1810, on Old
Oak Common, near Uxbridge, when the odds were six to four in his favour
at setting-to; but, after a contest of one hour and nine minutes, he was
reluctantly compelled to give in. He fought like a hero, and, although
defeated, reflected credit on the name of Cribb.</p>

<p class='c007'>After his brother Tom had beaten Molineaux, on September 21, 1811, at
Thistleton Gap, he entered the ring, for a subscription purse of £20, with
Ned Maltby, a Nottinghamshire lad. It was a determined battle for the
time it lasted, thirteen rounds; but George was again not only conquered
but severely punished. Maltby was not much the worse.</p>

<p class='c007'>George, like his brother, was a slow fighter, but sparred tolerably well.
In height, five feet eight inches and a half, and nearly eleven stone in
weight.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>SILVERTHORNE.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>From his contests with Tom Belcher, Dogherty, and Burn, we are induced
to mention Silverthorne. It appears that this boxer, who came out under
the patronage of Caleb Baldwin, was a native of the county of Somerset, but
not a Bristolian. From his style of setting-to, Caleb, no mean judge of such
matters, formed a high opinion of his capabilities, and procured him patronage
for a battle for 100 guineas, with Dan Dogherty, then in high repute. The
battle came off at Coombe Warren, near Kingston, June 11, 1811, Caleb
Baldwin seconding his <em>protegé</em>, assisted by Bill Gibbons. Dogherty was
waited upon by Dick Hall and Power. We copy the report from “Pancratia,”
pp. 353‒355. There is none in “Boxiana.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—At half past twelve the men
stood up. Silverthorne stood five feet eight
inches, and weighed eleven stone two pounds;
Dogherty, eleven stone eight pounds, five feet
nine inches, so that there was not a great
disparity. Both sparred with great caution.
Dogherty tried a right-handed hit, but was
short. Silverthorne returned sharply with the
left. They rallied courageously, and exchanged
hit for hit, until Dogherty went down on the
saving suit. (Six to four on Silverthorne.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Dogherty was touched under the eye,
but smiled and put in a blow on Silverthorne’s
ribs that left a red mark. The
latter returned at the nob, but hit round;
another rally, and no best on either side.
Silverthorne got Dogherty down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Both men went to work rather hurriedly,
and were soon engaged in a desperate
rally. Silverthorne stuck up, and though
he threw away many blows by his round
method of fighting, bored his opponent to
every part of the ring. Dogherty exerted
all his skill, and not unsuccessfully, on his
adversary’s head, but being at length very
weak, fell by a slight hit. (Seven to two on
Silverthorne.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Dogherty bled freely; but he commenced
a sharp rally, and put in a good
body blow, which somewhat staggered his
opponent. In endeavouring to repeat, Silverthorne
dexterously struck him on the
head and brought him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Exactly as in the last round. Dogherty
put in a body blow, and Silverthorne
returned on the head. A rally, and Dogherty
brought down his opponent for the first time
by a severe blow on the head.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—A rally; Dogherty soon laid low.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Dogherty, very gay, appeared first to
his time, and successfully planted a good hit
over the head. Silverthorne made play,
seemed distressed, hit awkwardly, and received
a severe right-handed facer. He
still, however, bored in, and commenced
another rally. Hits were exchanged for a
minute and a half, each appearing totally
regardless of blows. Dogherty’s superior
science gave him the advantage, and Silverthorne
at length fell through weakness.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Silverthorne rallied. Dogherty threw
in a good hit over his opponent’s mouth, but
was afterwards knocked down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Both seemed distressed for wind, and
sparred for some time. Dogherty put in a
more forcible body blow than could have
been expected. Silverthorne returned on
the head and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Dogherty commenced a rally, and
Silverthorne, by a tremendous blow, knocked
him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—It was with difficulty Dogherty could
be got off his second’s knee; he, however,
went in with courage, and fought until
knocked down.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Dogherty was again brought to the
scratch, and made play, although almost in
a doubled state. The combatants managed
a rally, but in a state of weakness perhaps
unparalleled; they could stand, but although
within arm’s length were incapable of hitting.
Silverthorne, however, recovered, and
knocked down his opponent for the last time.</p>

<p class='c022'>The contest lasted twenty-two minutes.
A pigeon was immediately despatched to
Jem Belcher’s, but in passing over Wimbledon
Common it fell a prey to the gun of
some cockney spoil-sport. Both combatants
were dreadfully beaten, and were immediately
put to bed and bled. Silverthorne
proved himself a worthy disciple of Caleb,
and possesses that degree of strength which
cannot fail to make him formidable to men
of his own weight. Dogherty’s strength
failed somewhat sooner than usual, which
was attributed to indisposition.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>This remarkable success so elated Caleb and his friends that they at once
proposed a match with Tom Belcher for 100 guineas. What came of this
may be seen at pages 158, 159, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Silverthorne, who bore the character of a steady, temperate, and well-conducted
man, now publicly announced his retirement from the ring, in
reply to a challenge from Dogherty, adding, he was resolved not to fight,
“except when the necessity of the moment forced it upon him, when he
hoped he should never be found backward to defend himself.” However, in
1812, at Coombe Warren, being provoked by Ben Burn, he departed from
his resolution, and gave that boxer a thorough thrashing. From this time
forth, though his name is sometimes mentioned, we hear no more of Silverthorne
in the ring. In 1821 (May), we find the following in “Notices of
Boxers who have retired from the P. R.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Silverthorne</span>, once distinguished for his contests with Dogherty and
Belcher. He is a teacher in a Sunday school, highly respected, and follows
his business as a master fishmonger.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'>JACK POWER.</h4>

<p class='c013'>With by no means first-rate qualifications, Jack Power is one of the
examples of what personal popularity will do in exaggerating mediocrity
into the foremost position. In the first volume of “Boxiana” many pages
are given to Power, and in the second an obituary eulogium, from which we
extract the salient points.</p>

<p class='c007'>Power was born in London on the 8th of August, 1790, and descended
from Irish parents. His father apprenticed him to a plumber, and Pierce
Egan gives us the usual number of six-feet-two men, butchers, etc., who
surrendered to “our hero” while yet a stripling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Power’s first regular ring battle was with Dogherty, on the 25th of
October, 1808, at Moulsey Hurst. This was the third battle on that day:
the first being Tom Cribb’s victory over Gregson; the second, Tom Belcher’s
conquest of Bill Cropley. The reporter simply says, “After a game battle
of one hour and a quarter, Dogherty was triumphant.” Egan says,
“Dogherty gave in three times during the fight; but Power being a new
one, and Dogherty more experienced, it was managed in that sort of way,
that the latter was pronounced the victor.” What this may mean we cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>tell, with “the Duke of York, the Marquis of Tweeddale, Lords Yarmouth,
Craven, Barrymore, Brook, and Somerville, and Paul Methuen on the
ground” (“Pancratia,” p. 322), and with Fletcher Reid as umpire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Power’s next battle was with one Frere, April 1, 1809, which he won in
twenty-one minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some ridiculous “turns-up” follow (“Boxiana,” pp. 458‒460), which we
shall omit, to come to Power’s best fight, that with Joel King, for 50 guineas
a-side, July 16, 1811, at Moulsey Hurst. The report is from “Pancratia,”
pp. 360, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i> “At twelve o’clock the combatants appeared. King, who
was a new candidate for pugilistic honours, was accompanied by Richmond
and Hall; Power attended by Bob Clarke and Paddington Jones. Odds, five
to four on Power.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—King attempted to plant a
forcible right-hander; Power stopped him,
and hit one two, left and right, well planted
on the head and body. King fell. (First
knock-down bets decided.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—King did not appear intimidated; he
again made play, and planted a good right-handed
hit on his opponent’s throat; his left-hand
fell short. Power with great quickness
threw in a severe left-handed facer, and
brought him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—A good rally, several blows well exchanged.
Power scientifically planted one
with the left hand. King returned with the
right. They closed and both fell. (Two to
one in favour of Power.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Power hit left and right, and King
returned very forcibly in the throat. They
closed, and Power threw his opponent again.
(Betting two points more in favour of King
than at setting to.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—King planted a left-handed hit, but out
of distance. He followed quickly with his
right, which Power cleverly avoided. They
closed, and Power threw King a cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Both made play, King with his right,
Power with the left, at the same instant;
the former told on the head. Some good
trying hits followed, and, upon the whole,
the round was in favour of King: notwithstanding
Power again threw him a cross-buttock.
In doing this, with too much
eagerness Power received a hurt on the
right shoulder against a stake, which, if
it did not disable him, proved a severe
hindrance.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—In this round Power changed his mode
of fighting, endeavouring to avert the punishing
right-handed blows of his adversary, and
getting away to hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Power put in a good blow on the
mouth, got away, repeated it, and gave an
excellent specimen of science by repeating
his blows, and avoiding his adversary’s, until
King fell, bleeding copiously.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—King commenced a rally, in which he
evidently had the advantage, throwing in
straight right-handed hits with great dexterity.
His superior strength gave him the
advantage, but at length he received a violent
cross-buttock.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—King’s face was much disfigured.
Power put in a severe one two in the mouth,
followed by a scientific hit on the throat,
which brought King down.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—A good rally, and both fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Another rally. Power hit his opponent,
staggering away, with the right. King
courageously renewed the rally, and returned
his adversary’s hits with the gluttony of a
Cribb, and at length succeeded in throwing
him.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Power, by another blow in the mouth,
brought King again on the floor. Power
continued fighting at points until he was
scarcely able to administer the beating his
adversary seemed to require to satisfy him.
In the</p>

<p class='c022'>26th.—Betting came to six to four; and
although the left side of King’s head was a
sorry sight for any feeling spectator to view,
he still fought with such determined bravery
as never can be forgotten by his enemies or
too highly appreciated by his friends. At the
expiration of the</p>

<p class='c022'>46th.—When every one evidently saw he
had no chance of success, he was urged,
particularly by his backers, to resign, but
still expressing anxiety for the continuation
of the conflict, even in opposition to advice,
he was allowed to go up, but merely to be
sent down by a push. The token of surrender
was made, and Power hailed the
victor, after a game battle of fifty-seven
minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>In October, 1801, Power’s friends proposed a match with Tom Belcher, a
deposit was made, but they thought better of it and forfeited.</p>

<p class='c007'>Power now travelled through the provinces as a teacher of boxing. During
this tour he ruptured a blood-vessel, and had a severe attack of pleurisy.
Before his entire restoration to health, he imprudently suffered himself to be
matched with Jack Carter for 100 guineas. The battle took place at Rickmansworth,
Hertfordshire, November 16, 1812. Power was seconded on
this occasion by the Champion, Tom Cribb; Carter by Bittoon and Tom
Jones.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pierce Egan says, “It would be superfluous to detail the rounds of this
battle, which continued one hour and twenty-five minutes; suffice it to say
that the conduct of Power this day was worthy all praise. Passing previously
a restless night, afflicted with a cough, and somewhat nervous in his
habit, he entered the ring under these disadvantages to contend against an
adversary, his superior in height, strength, constitution, perfectly in health,
and not deficient in pugilistic acquirements. It was a tremendous task, a
daring attempt; and superlative science, and that alone, gave the victory to
Power. It required something more than fortitude to act thus in opposition
to nature, as well as considerable ingenuity in husbanding his strength to
reduce his opponent to his own level. This Power effected, when he grappled
with his opponent upon superior terms; his strength gone, and his science
inferior, Carter was conquered with elegance and certainty. Upon no occasion
whatever were the knowing ones so completely ‘out of their know.’
Carter, although defeated, showed that he was not without game; but Power
completely astonished the most experienced of the Fancy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Power had a set-to with Richmond (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>) at a sparring match at the
Fives Court, on Dutch Sam’s benefit, soon after the above contest. Something
about a white feather being mentioned, Power instantly mounted the
stage, and addressed the spectators thus:—“Upon the day previous to the
night when I fought Richmond I was following my business as a plumber,
in making paint. The fumes of white lead are of so strong and poisonous
a quality, that, to prevent any serious effects operating upon the constitution,
we are necessitated to drink a quantity of castor oil; in addition to which I
had been drinking, which rendered me then unprepared; but now,” said
Power, “if Richmond can take out the white feather, as he pleases to term
it, that I possess (stripping off his clothes), let him come up here, and I will
fight him instantly for £50.” At his own benefit he again offered to fight
Richmond.</p>

<p class='c007'>Power’s excesses are thus leniently touched upon in “Boxiana:”—“In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>concluding this sketch, the most painful part remains to be performed. No
boxer commenced his milling career with a fairer prospect to arrive at the
top of the tree, or become a fixed star in the pugilistic hemisphere, than
Jack Power; but, possessing a gaiety of disposition which could brook no
restraint, the fascinating charms of company and the enlivening glass proving
too powerful for his youth and inexperience to withstand, he plunged into
excesses which induced premature debility. In this last battle, although
gaining the victory, he endangered his existence. From being stripped in
the open air for nearly an hour and a half, the severity of the weather
afflicted him so seriously, that for several hours his frame did not experience
the least warmth whatever, notwithstanding the best medical treatment was
resorted to. His sufferings were acute, and he observed, ‘All the milling
that he had received in the whole course of his pugilistic career was trifling
in comparison with the pain he sustained on his return to a state of convalescence.’
He, however, was not long in returning to the metropolis to
receive those congratulations which his noble courage had so justly entitled
him to. The supporters of pugilism gave him a most flattering reception, so
that Power’s time was principally occupied with the pleasures of society, and
the enlivening charms of the bottle. Power was no churl, full of good
humour in company, and his song was always ready when called for to
support the cause of harmony.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At a sparring exhibition which took place at the Fives Court soon after,
when Jack merely looked in as a visitor, and Carter was present, several of
the amateurs expressed a wish to witness a set-to between them. It proved
a sharp contest; but the superiority was decidedly, in point of science, as in
the fight, in favour of Power.</p>

<p class='c007'>A public dinner, in honour of Power’s victory over Carter, took place at
Mr. Davenport’s, the Three Pigeons, Houndsditch, when Jack presided, supported
by Tom Cribb. Conviviality was the order of the day; and, upon
the introduction of Carter, the behaviour of Power to his fallen adversary was
attentive, generous, and manly, and he strongly recommended him to the attention
of the fancy in general. Soon after this period he rapidly declined, and
endeavoured to recruit his health by a journey to Oxford. It proved too
late, and the last stage of consumption was reducing him daily. He witnessed
the memorable set-to of Molineaux and Carter, and expressed himself
astonished to hear it termed “fighting!” He returned to his dwelling in
Plough Court, Fetter Lane, not only exhausted in person, but, to add to his
afflictions, one of his children took ill and died. Mr. Jackson, ever attentive
to the wants of brother pugilists, on being made acquainted with his peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>situation, instantly made a collection for him among the patrons of the
science. His disorder was so flattering that, at times when his spirits were
good, he would observe, “Let me get but a little better, and I’ll show the
lads how to fight; many of those that pretend to teach it scarcely know anything
about the sound principles of milling—they are only sparrers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Power departed this life June 2, 1813, at the early age of twenty-three,
and lies interred in the burial ground of St. Giles’s-in-the-Fields. He was
in height about five feet nine inches and a half, and in weight twelve stone.
He turned out several good pupils.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>WILLIAM NOSWORTHY, THE BAKER.</h4>

<p class='c013'>As the conqueror of the renowned Dutch Sam, albeit in the day of his
decadence, the name of Nosworthy is preserved from oblivion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his boyish days, Nosworthy, it appears, was not altogether unknown in
Devonshire, both as a wrestler and pugilist. He was born at Kenn, a parish
in the hundred of Exminster, of respectable connections, on the 1st of May,
1786. He was of an athletic, prepossessing appearance, and extremely well
made. In height five feet six inches, and weighing about eleven stone.
In disposition he was cheerful, good-natured, and inoffensive; but in the
ring Nosworthy was a glutton of the first mould. Several sporting characters
denominated him the “Young Chicken,” from some likeness he bore to the
celebrated Hen. Pearce.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The historian” having given us the usual “servings out,” “polishings
off,” etc., of unknown opponents, judiciously omitted by the compiler of
“Fistiana,” brings Nosworthy to town. Here it appears that “the Baker”
attended a Devon and Cornwall gathering of wrestlers, and was matched
against one Pentikin, whom he threw.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c009'><sup>[165]</sup></a> The defeated wrestler offered to post
a guinea and thrash Nosworthy for the stake. The contest took place on the
3rd of May, 1808, in Pancras Fields. Nosworthy was seconded by Tom
Jones and Bill Ryan. The superiority was evidently on the part of Nosworthy
for the first twenty minutes, Pentikin being milled in all directions.
It was presumed that, had the fight continued without any interruption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>victory was by no means doubtful on the side of Nosworthy, who had, at
this period of the battle, considerably reduced the strength of his opponent.
But Nosworthy was here representing a county partisanship of Devon <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</span></i>
Cornwall, and was moreover unknown in comparison to Pentikin. The ring,
it is said, was broken in consequence, much confusion ensued, and some
delay occurred before the combatants could appear in a new ring. The
contest was renewed with increased ardour, and Pentikin appeared more
fresh from the delay. Reciprocal fighting continued for one hour and twenty-five
minutes, when Nosworthy was reduced to insensibility, and carried off
the ground by his brother. The game he displayed was highly praised.
Pentikin, although the conqueror, could not be induced again to face his
fallen adversary, and forfeited three times to Nosworthy.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c009'><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>After some irregular battles the bakers of the metropolis, looking upon
Nosworthy as a leader in their sporting circle, a match for ten guineas a-side
was made between him and Barnard Levy, a Jew, which took place at
Golder’s Green. Levy was known to be a good man, and proved himself
deserving of that character throughout the fight. Nosworthy was not in
condition, and the Jew maintained an evident superiority for the long space
of two hours. The game displayed by the Baker astonished every one present—he
fought undismayed, and showed himself a “taker” of no common
mould. Notwithstanding the punishment the Jew had administered, he
could not take the fight out of him, and at length became exhausted. Nosworthy,
contrary to all expectation, appeared refreshed, and finished the Jew
in high style during the last twenty-five minutes. From this conquest the
Baker gained ground. The fight lasted two hours and twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Martin, an active lively boxer, and much fancied by his own people, the
Jews, was now pitted against Nosworthy for a purse of 25 guineas, at
Moulsey Hurst, on the 29th of March, 1814. High expectations were
formed of the pugilistic talents of Martin, but the Baker soon put his skill
and manœuvres at defiance. Joe Ward and Paddington Jones seconded
Nosworthy, and Little Puss and Jacobs attended upon Martin. It was two
to one in favour of the Jew previous to the battle, betting brisk.</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On setting-to considerable
expectation was formed as to the talents
of the Jew, who commenced with much
gaiety; but Nosworthy planted a tremendous
hit on Martin’s mouth, which not
only drew a profusion of claret, but he
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The Jew, more cautious than heretofore,
sparred for advantage, but ultimately
he was again floored. (The two to one had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>now all vanished, and even betting was the
truth of the matter.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Nosworthy began to serve the Jew in
style, and his hits told tremendously. Martin
made a good round of it, but fell rather
distressed. The dead men now opened their
mouths wide, and loudly offered six to four
on the Master of the Rolls.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Martin, with much activity, planted a
good facer; but Nosworthy again finished
the round in high style.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—The Israelite’s nob was peppered, and
his body also much punished; and Nosworthy,
with great severity, hit him right
through the ropes. (Seven to four on Nosworthy.)</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—It would be superfluous to detail the
remaining rounds. Nosworthy had it all
his own way, notwithstanding Martin resorted
to his old method of falling, to tire
out his opponent. In thirty-six minutes the
Jew was completely defeated, and Nosworthy
increased his fame as a boxer.</p>

<p class='c013'>After some minor affairs, we come to Nosworthy’s great match with the
Phenomenon, Dutch Sam. Pierce Egan expends pages of wonderment, conjecture,
and exclamation on the fact that a strong, young, resolute man, and
a good boxer withal, should have beaten a gin-drinking stale pugilist, who
would not even train for the battle. We now come to the report.</p>

<p class='c007'>Five years had nearly elapsed since Sam had exhibited in the prize-ring.
The curiosity to see him once more display his great pugilistic skill drew
together an unusual number of spectators. Neither bad roads nor torrents of
rain could check the interest excited by this battle. Vehicles of all descriptions
for weeks before were put in requisition to reach the destined spot, and
pedestrians out of number were not dismayed in tramping through thick and
thin for sixteen miles. The vast collection of carriages on the Hurst excited
the astonishment of every one, and some hundreds were on the spot who did
not even see the battle. Several marquees were erected for accommodation.
The sum to be contended for, in a twenty feet ring, was £50 a-side and a
purse given by the Pugilistic Club of 25 guineas. At a few minutes before
one Nosworthy entered the ring, attended by his seconds, Bill Cropley and
Silverthorne, and was loudly cheered for his confidence, in daring to face so
acknowledged a boxer as the Jew. Sam soon followed, and received every
mark of gratifying attention from the surrounding multitude. Ben Medley
and Puss were his attendants. A heavy shower of rain could not delay their
thirst for fame.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On the combatants approaching
each other, and shaking hands in the
usual way, the difference of person was so
manifest that an ordinary spectator must
have given the preference to the Baker, from
the roundness of his frame, the firmness of
his step, and the cheerfulness of his countenance.
He must have been a novice, indeed,
not to have discovered the wretched condition
of Sam upon his throwing off his clothes.
His ribs were spare in the extreme; his face,
which hitherto had assumed such a formidable
aspect, and his fierce eyes that seemed upon
similar occasions to have penetrated into
the very souls of his opponents, appeared
clouded with doubt and anxiety. It was
altogether a different frontispiece. Dejection,
arising from dissipation, was marked
strongly on his features. As for his legs, as
if Sam had anticipated that they might tell
against him, he, for the first time in his life,
preferred fighting in gaiters and breeches.
The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> portrayed, a worn-out man
rather than a boxer entering the prize-ring,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>prepared to vanquish youth, health, and
strength. But all these objections were
as a feather in the scale against the Jew.
Weather could not affect him; no one could
punish him; he hit as hard as Cribb; he was
no mannerist; he set-to a hundred different
ways; he altered his mode of fighting as circumstances
required. Many seemed really to
think, and plenty were forward enough to
urge, that Sam was as well, if not better,
without training, than undergoing the systematic
precaution of invigorating the <em>stamina</em>.
In short, he was the phenomenon of the
fighting world; everything but a losing man.
The recollection that he had beaten all the
best men for a series of years that had been
pitted against him, gave a double confidence
to these sanguine opinions; and what was Sam
now called upon to perform at the top of his
glory? Why, to enter the lists with a boxer,
who, to say the best, was but of considerable
obscurity. Who for a moment would listen
to a comparison made between Nosworthy
and the hardy and brave Champion of Westminster,
who had fallen beneath the conquering
arm of Sam? or with that truly
elegant scientific pugilist, Tom Belcher, who
had twice surrendered up his laurels to this
distinguished Jew. Cropley too, who ought
never to be mentioned without praise, ranking
as a superior scientific boxer, was tremendously
beaten by him; and his last
antagonist, Ben Medley, possessing sound
fighting pretensions, true game, and science,
was reluctantly compelled to acknowledge
his vast superiority. The renowned Dutch
Sam was once more before his friends; and
his fanciers were so confident of his adding
another laurel to his brow, that bets to an
extravagant amount were loudly offered. To
have named the Baker as having anything
like a chance, was out of the question; but,
at this period, to have proposed an even bet
that Nosworthy won, would have been
laughed at, as betraying a total ignorance
in matters of sport. Such was the state of
things upon the combatants facing each
other; and the great superiority of the Jew
was expected to be witnessed every instant.
The decision was near at hand, and the
Baker, eager to commence the attack, displayed
more of valorous spirit than scientific
precision. In making play, his distances
proved incorrect, and two blows fell short.
Sam gained nothing by this opening. Nosworthy,
full of resolution, followed up the
Jew, appearing rather too rapid in his
manner to take any particular aim, and
seemed to prefer going in, to trusting to
those advantages that are sometimes obtained
in sparring. Sam made a slight hit
upon the Baker’s nob, but ultimately went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The eagerness of the Baker appeared
to supersede every other consideration. He
again hit short; but Sam did not miss this
opportunity, and returned right and left,
drawing the cork of the Master of the Rolls.
Nosworthy, it seemed, had made up his mind
to smash the Jew, and, in his haste to get at
Sam, slipped and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The Baker, determined in his mode of
warfare, resolutely made up to Sam, but the
Jew warded off the force of the blows with
much adroitness. Nosworthy received a hit
from Sam, and went down, but his fall was
attributed more to the slippery state of the
turf than to the severity of the blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—This round commenced with severe
fighting, and much activity was displayed on
both sides. Some good hits were exchanged.
The Baker drove Sam before him to the ropes,
and here it was that Nosworthy showed his
superiority by putting in three tremendous
blows. Sam fell, evidently distressed, and
his breath was nearly hit out of his body, by
a terrible blow he received upon his breast.
His friends, however, thought that his conduct
was a mere <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</span></i>. In fact,
nothing could shake their opinion that the
Jew was playing a sure game, by letting the
Baker make the most of his strength, in
order that, at a more advanced stage of the
battle, he would become exhausted, when he
might be easily “kneaded” to answer the
purpose of the Israelite.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—It was in this round that Sam found
out what sort of a customer he had to deal
with. He was also convinced, too late, that
the chance was against him: he could not
resist the hardy blows of the Baker, nor had
he room enough to get away from him.
Sam’s hits produced no effect upon the
courage of Nosworthy, who went in in
such an unusual manner to anything the
Jew had experienced with any of his other
competitors, that he was confounded. His
wonted fortitude seemed to have deserted
him, and dismay taken possession of his
mind: he went down quite exhausted. But
however Sam might feel that he was sent
down against his will, it did not appear in
that light to his backers, who generally
looked upon this as nothing more than artifice
of the Jew to weaken and tire out his
adversary. A few persons who were not
quite so infatuated with the appearance of
things, hedged off a little of their four to
one. Some others ventured upon even betting;
but this latter circumstance was by
no means general.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Sam was scarcely upon his legs and
set-to, when Nosworthy put in a blow that
sent him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—The Baker, always ready, proved himself
a resolute and skilful boxer. He did
not wish to lose time by any useless display
of scientific attitudes. The proud name of
Sam proved no terror or drawback to his
exertions: he went in with as much gaiety
as if he had been only contending with a
novice, instead of fighting with a boxer who
had performed such wonders in the pugilistic
annals. Nosworthy planted some good
blows, and the Jew was again down on the
turf.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>8.—The science of Sam was conspicuous
in this round, but the strength of his opponent
was not to be reduced. The Jew put
in some good hits in a smart rally, but he
could not divert the Baker from his purpose,
and Sam went down again much exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Nosworthy commenced this round
with his usual spirit, by driving Sam again
to the ropes, where he punished him severely.
Sam, notwithstanding, planted some hard
blows, but the impetuosity of the Baker
carried all before him. The best efforts of
the Jew, however well directed, seemed as
useless as if he had been trying to stem a
torrent. At this period the deeply-interested
ones perceived something in the Baker they
had not expected. That a chance must not
be thrown away when four to one had been
betted. A bustle now commenced, and the
outer ring was broken. The populace pressed
heavily against the roped ring, bearing down
all opposition to keep them off, and many
persons crossed the ropes, to the confusion of
the combatants. However we might be disposed
to attribute this disorder of the ring
as the effect of accident, owing to the great
concourse of spectators, to what account can
we place the conduct of a strong man endeavouring
to force out of the ground one of
the stakes which supported the ring, and
which attempt was only prevented by the
manly interference of the Champion of England?
Nosworthy appeared at the mark, and
called out to Sam to observe he was ready, but
the Jew declined setting-to till the ring was
cleared out. It may not be improper here
to remark that, if Sam had decidedly felt in
his own person he was, or must be eventually
beaten, if he continued the contest, it is
natural to infer that he would have saved
the money of his friends by taking the advantage
of this interruption in making at
least a drawn battle; but the Jew wished to
fight it out. In clearing out the ring, the
confusion beggared all description. The
whips and sticks were laid on heavily. In
the course of about twelve minutes the desired
object was attained, when the combatants
once more commenced operations.</p>

<p class='c022'>It would be superfluous to detail the remainder
of the rounds, in number thirty-eight.
Complete sameness pervaded the
whole of them; and Sam, who had hitherto
portrayed the hero, now scarcely exhibited
the traits of a second-rate pugilist. The
ferocity which had so terrified his opponents
was no longer visible; indeed he exhibited
weakness and distress early in the fight. It
is curious to remark that he never once
knocked down Nosworthy; but, on the contrary,
was either floored or went down every
round, with the exception of about three.
Still the friends of Sam, and particularly
those denominated “the flash side,” relying
on his experience and judgment, flattered
themselves it was all right, that he was
aiming to bring down Nosworthy to his own
pitch, to obtain any conquest, and give a
good opportunity of betting. But they wofully
deceived themselves; the wished for
change never arrived.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Nosworthy proved himself a
confident boxer. If his movements were
not equal to the scientific precision of Tom
Belcher, his undaunted resolution and courage,
from the commencement to the termination
of the fight, reminded many of the
spectators of that peculiar forte of Bill
Hooper. The Baker was a two-handed
hitter, and seemed perfectly awake to the
business before him. From this mode of
attack the debilitated Jew stood no chance
whatever. The strength of Sam, once so
much the theme of his backers, was missing,
and he appeared a mere shadow of his
former self. He could not knock down Nosworthy,
or even hit him away. This defeat
of a great favourite may operate as a useful
lesson: youth and strength must be served;
and never was the position more clearly and
decisively shown than in this instance. Sam
was turned of forty-one years of age, and
his irregularities of life must have dilapidated
as fine a constitution as was ever possessed
by man. His opponent, a young man
of twenty-eight, was in good health, of great
strength, and weighed a stone and a half
more than the Jew; besides, we are to take
into the scale that Nosworthy was not destitute
of skill, and possessed unimpeachable
bottom, which had shown itself in all the
battles he had fought. But calculation was
out of the question. The game of chance,
even, was completely lost sight of. “To a
certainty, to a certainty,” was the cry of
nearly the whole of the fancy; and any
opinion expressed in favour of the Baker was
instantly silenced by four to one, treated as
a want of judgment, and laughed at with
derision and contempt. Upon Sam’s resigning
the contest, a general consternation took
place among the backers of the hero. If
the Jews were weighed down with grief, the
Christians were equally miserable and chapfallen
at this unexpected defeat. So complete
a cleaning out, it is supposed, had not
taken place in the boxing world, since the
conquest obtained by Slack. It is computed
that, in different parts of the kingdom,
£100,000 at least were lost upon this battle.
In the dismay of the moment, the exclamations
of the losers were loud and vehement.
“’Tis impossible!” said many. “It must
be a cross!” The combatants did not appear
to be so much punished as might have
been expected. But the case was altered;
instead of giving, as heretofore, Sam now
received punishment. Sam must have suffered
terribly from the repeated knock-down
blows he experienced; but his frame was of
so close a texture that it did not exhibit
marks of punishment like most other men.
This was an important point towards victory
on his side, by disheartening his antagonists,
who, however they might mill him, could
not see the result of their efforts, from Sam’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>appearing fresh and unhurt. Had Sam
properly attended to his training, had he
viewed the consequences of the battle in the
light of an experienced veteran, bearing in
mind that he had everything to lose, and but
little to gain, the sequel might have proved
different. His experience and judgment
should also have pointed to him, that youth,
strength, science, and determined resolution
were not to be disposed of as matters of
course; that it was not a mere sporting
article he had to pink for his amusement—one
who had presumptuously dared to enter
the lists against so mighty and renowned a
chief. Some caution, it might be presumed,
was necessary when it was also known to
him his antagonist was above a novice; that
Nosworthy was an energetic boxer, aspiring
to reach the top of the tree. But the conquests
of Sam had made him forget himself.
Fame and flattery had cheated him. The
whole race of pugilists viewed him as a
phenomenon, and impressed with this character,
it should seem, latterly, that poor
Sam “had crept so much into favour with
himself,” that he vainly imagined he had
only to appear in the ring, and his name
alone was sufficient to vanquish any pugilist
who might have the temerity to oppose
him. He at length fell a victim to “self-conceit”
and ill-timed flattery.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fame which Nosworthy earned on this occasion led to several challenges,
among others to one from the renowned and hardy Scroggins, which
he accepted, and they met on June 16, 1815, at Moulsey Hurst. The details
of this battle will be found in the Life of <span class='sc'>Scroggins</span>, p. 416, who was on
this, as on many other hard fought fields, the conqueror. His friends attributed
this defeat to bad condition; but the truth seems to be that in
Scroggins, Bill Nosworthy met a miller of his own stamp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bill was afterwards matched to fight George Curtis, but the latter paid
forfeit from ill-health.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nosworthy felt his defeat by the hardy little tar, and never recovered his
usual spirits. Dissipation and excessive drinking hurried him into a consumption,
and in the last stage of this frightful disease, he, with the assistance
of a few friends, left London for Lympstor, in Devonshire; but, in
October 26, 1816, while resting at Exeter, he received his final knock-down,
scarcely surviving the Jew three months. His connections in Devon were
very respectable, and his manners, until depraved by excessive drink, pleasing,
while his appearance was prepossessing.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BEN BURN (“UNCLE BEN”)—1810‒1834.</h4>

<p class='c013'>There was nothing in the pugilistic exploits of the first of the Burn family
(“Uncle Ben,” as he was afterwards termed, on account of the higher merits
of his “nevvy”) to deserve particular record. He was well known as a
sparrer with the “big ’uns” at the Fives Court, a match-maker, a second, a
ring attendant, and a sporting publican. He beat J. Christie on Highgate
Common, January 1, 1810, for 40 guineas. Fought Flanagan for 100 guineas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>March 27, 1814, whom he also defeated. His after fights were with
Dogherty, Silverthorne, Palmer Jones, Tom Spring, and Tom Oliver, by all
of whom he was beaten. He also had a set-to with “Gibletts” (Charles
Grantham), whom he beat in twenty minutes in a room fight in Bow Street,
June 13, 1821. His last appearance (which is omitted under his name in
“Fistiana”) was with Old Tom Oliver, in 1834, who defeated him at
Hampton in six rounds, twenty-four minutes, for £25 a-side, as will be seen
under the Memoir of <span class='sc'>Oliver</span>.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>HARRY HARMER, THE COPPERSMITH—1812‒1815.</h4>

<p class='c013'>This scientific pugilist was allied to the family of the Belchers, and was
born in the place known as the Horse Fair, Bristol, in 1784. His sparring
was for many years the theme of admiration. His height, five feet eight
inches and a half; his weight, eleven stone and a few pounds. It does not
appear that Harmer, although reared in the hot-bed of pugilists, exhibited in
any public scientific contest previous to his arrival in the metropolis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The superior style he displayed in his first battle with Maltby, the latter
having vanquished George Cribb and Cope, brought Harmer into notice with
the admirers of pugilism. With Jack Ford, in his second contest, he also
rose a step higher; and in his third and last battle, with Shelton, he established
his reputation as a game and first-rate boxer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Harmer entered the lists with Maltby on Thursday, June 12, 1812, at
Wilsden Green, for a purse of £25 guineas. Maltby was the favourite six
to four, and nearly a stone heavier than Harmer, who was a stranger to the
ring. Tom Jones and Cropley seconded Maltby, and Belcher and Richmond
attended upon Harmer. At one o’clock the men set-to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Both the combatants seemed
intent on fighting, and began without ceremony;
they, however, soon disengaged from
a close, and Harmer, with great dexterity,
planted a severe right-handed hit on one of
Maltby’s peepers without receiving any return.
Maltby, with much determination,
fought his way into a close, and, in a trial
of strength to obtain the throw, they both
fell, Harmer uppermost. (The odds rather
lowered, and Harmer became attractive.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Harmer commenced in grand style,
and planted a left-handed blow upon
Maltby’s nose, which, added to his already
damaged eye, changed the appearance of his
face. A desperate rally occurred, and hit
for hit took place, when Maltby was floored
from a severe blow on his forehead. (The
partizans of Harmer began loudly to applaud,
and offered five to four upon his
winning.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The men were both on their mettle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>and considerable execution was done on both
sides. Maltby stood up like a hero, and
satisfied the spectators he had not a particle
of flinching in his composition. A rally
ensued, and much reciprocal hitting occurred.
The right hand of Maltby punished
Harmer’s body so severely that, from one
tremendous hit, he went staggering away
like a drunken man; but the latter, to the
astonishment of the ring, returned hastily
upon his opponent, and, in a finishing style
of execution, Maltby went down. It was
now seen that the reach of Harmer gave him
the superiority, and his friends sported the
odds without hesitation.</p>

<p class='c022'>4 to 15 and last.—At this early stage of
the fight Maltby was reduced. Harmer
made play in every round, and kept the lead
in gallant style. From the quickness of
Harry, he literally beat his man stupid.
Maltby contended, in the most determined
manner, for thirty-seven minutes, when
nature was so exhausted, that he was carried
out of the ring by his seconds.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this manly specimen Harmer became the object of considerable
conversation in the pugilistic circles; his length, quickness, and punishing
hitting deterred a few of the fighting men from entering the lists with him,
till Jack Ford was matched with him for a purse of 25 guineas.</p>

<p class='c007'>This battle took place on the 23rd of August, 1813, a mile to the eastward
of St. Nicholas, in Kent, upon the land of Mr. Neale, a Kentish yeoman, a
short distance from Margate. The veteran Joe Ward and Hall seconded
Harmer; Paddington Jones and Clark attended upon Ford.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Harry commenced fighting
with great confidence by making play right
and left, but without much effect, Ford
having stopped and returned. In closing,
they both went down. The betting, which
had been previously rather high upon Harmer,
was now rather reduced, it appearing
that Ford would not let his nob receive that
severe punishment which Harmer had dealt
out so liberally upon Maltby. (Five to four
upon Harmer.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—A good rally, and both the combatants
upon their mettle. Ford most conspicuous,
but did not like the right hand of
Harmer. Strength on both sides was resorted
to in falling; but the advantages in
this round appeared on the side of Ford.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The right hand of Harmer got into
work, and the forehead of Ford received a
severe taste of his quality. The game of
the latter, however, was not so soon frightened
as to deter him from attempting to
adopt his favourite mode of in-fighting; and
several teasers did not frustrate Ford from
boring in upon his adversary, yet he still
lost by comparison, and was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—The truth must be told: the bad training
of Ford could no longer be concealed.
His wind was treacherous, and he was sparring
to gain time; but he guarded himself
so scientifically, that a short time elapsed
before any opening occurred whereby Harmer
could derive any advantage, when he at
length put in a heavy body blow on his
opponent, and Ford, with considerable dexterity,
returned a “sender” on the head of
Harmer. Equality was preserved in this
round; but Ford went down from a terrible
blow. (Brisk betting upon Harmer two to
one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Ford, full of pluck, rallied with spirit,
slashing away without any care respecting
himself; and Harmer was no ways behind
hand in hammering his opponent. Their
hitting told, and the round was not terminated
without considerable execution being
manifest. Harmer threw Ford. Weakness
now appeared on both sides.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Harmer received a severe hit in the
body and went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—In going in to rally, Harmer was repulsed
by Ford, when the latter for a short
period had the best of the milling. On
getting near the ropes, Harmer got Ford’s
nob under his left arm and fibbed him so
terribly that he was glad to put an end to it
by falling through his hands. Harmer was
now the favourite in every point of view.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Ford, always brave, showed he was
determined not to lose his character, and the
fortitude he exhibited in this round claimed
universal praise. Punishing without ceremony
took place upon both sides; and the
right hand of Harry, from a terrible hit he
planted upon Ford’s eye, was much injured.
The combatants stuck to each other hard
and fast, pelting away in all directions; but
the strength of Ford was leaving him, and
he held by the ropes, where the mastery of
Harmer was evident, by holding up his
opponent with his left hand and with his
right putting in some weighty blows. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>betting amateurs were now satisfied it was
all their own way, and offered to lay any
odds upon Harmer.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Ford had now received so much
severe punishment that it was evident he
was losing ground rapidly. He had given
such decided specimens of game in his other
contests, that it was well known he would
not relinquish fighting while anything like a
chance remained. He therefore summoned
all his courage to get a turn in his favour,
but was reduced to that state where superior
science and strength must be served. Ford,
from one leg being shorter than the other,
fought under peculiar disadvantages in this
respect, and when retreating, it appeared very
conspicuously. It now appeared that he fell
without a blow, but it was owing to this
defect.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Humanity of character should never be
forgotten, and it ought always to be recorded
as an example to other pugilists. Ford was
in an unfortunate situation against the ropes,
where a blow must have finished him; but
Harmer nobly disdained to take any advantage
of a brave competitor while a more
manly path presented itself; and he never
could show manhood in a finer style than in
walking away and leaving Ford to go down
himself.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Harmer now punished his antagonist
with ease and address till he went down, and
Ford was more enfeebled every round; but,
notwithstanding the milling he met with, he
could not be prevailed upon to give in until
the twenty-third round, when he was completely
told out.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Ford, although defeated,
showed that his pretensions to boxing were
good and scientific, and that he was not to
be got at without some difficulty. The importance
of training does not seem to operate
on pugilists in general; or, if they do understand
its value, it should seem that, in too
many instances, they do not strictly comply
with its regulations to obtain those essential
requisites toward victory—sound wind and
good condition. It was evident that Ford
suffered considerably from this neglect. As
an in-fighter he was able to do considerable
execution, but the length of Harmer was too
much for him. With Oliver, Ford contended
for two hours and ten minutes; and, notwithstanding
it was thought that he had
generally improved, yet with Harmer he
was disposed of in thirty-five minutes.
Ford’s body exhibited some severe marks of
punishment, and he was bled before he left
the ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>Harmer, after a year and a half had elapsed, was matched with Tom
Shelton, the navigator. It may not be improper to premise the occasion
of this battle. Shelton was introduced at the Fives Court, and ascended the
stage with Harmer, at Cribb’s benefit, on May 31, 1814, as a complete
novice. Shelton appeared determined for a downright mill, and attacked
Harmer furiously, endeavouring to show his abilities. Harry, with skill and
dexterity, parried off his strength, and put in some touches that drew forth
the claret. To call it sparring would be erroneous, it was complete roughing.
The impetuosity of Shelton was astonishing, and it was also curious to observe
the decided mode in which Harmer drove the former away from him. During
the contest Shelton was so sharply met by his antagonist, that he turned
completely round twice, and recommenced his attack. The science of
Harmer, however pre-eminent, was not enough to convince Shelton of his
superiority, and it at length became necessary for Harry to add strength to
his efforts to abate the rushing of his opponent. Harmer, at arms’ length,
gloved him severely, but, upon Shelton rushing in to mill, Harry got his
nob under his left arm, and with his right hand fibbed him so tightly that,
to prevent its proceeding to an actual fight, it was deemed prudent that no
more such sparring should take place between them in the Court. This was
Shelton’s first appearance; and, from the spirit he displayed, he was much
fancied by several of the amateurs. An opinion was entertained that he only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>wanted a better knowledge of boxing, in addition to his other requisites, to
make him a dangerous customer for any of his weight. In the course of a
twelvemonth he acquired considerable science; and, notwithstanding the
character Harmer maintained as a first-rate boxer, the capabilities of Shelton
were not viewed with indifference by many of Harry’s friends. The match
at length being made for 100 guineas, it created considerable interest in the
sporting circles, and on Tuesday, April 18, 1815, they met, in a twenty-four
feet roped ring, on Hounslow Heath, near the rivulet which divides the
heath from Twickenham Common. Shelton was the heavier man by some
pounds. Seven to four on Harmer eagerly taken by the friends of Shelton.
The spectators were exceedingly numerous. Richmond and Oliver were for
Shelton, and Tom Belcher and Bill Gibbons with Harmer. At one o’clock
the men shook hands and set-to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The determined quality of
Shelton was well known to the amateurs,
and great anxiety was manifested. The
navigator, eager to commence fighting, endeavoured
to plant two left-handed blows,
but his distance proving incorrect, Harmer
floored him in a twinkling, and the claret
was visible upon his face. (Loud shouting,
and two to one freely offered against Shelton.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The Navigator, from his eagerness to
do something, again hit short, as did Harmer
in returning. The men now got into a
sharp rally, when Harmer, from a slip, fell
down upon his knees, and received an accidental
blow from the suddenness of his situation.
“Foul!” “Fair!” was vociferated,
but the umpires knowing the real state of
the case, the battle did not suffer the slightest
interruption.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—This round was resolutely contested
on both sides, and the combatants, in a
tremendous rally, exchanged hit for hit with
a firmness that claimed applause from all
parts of the ring. Harmer, in point of
quickness, put in the most blows, and
finished the round by sending his man down.
(It was current betting five to two upon
Harmer.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Good reciprocal boxing, when, in closing,
Harmer was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Shelton, full of gaiety, made play, and
Harmer, from a slight hit, was again on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—The science of Harmer was seen to
much advantage in this round. From the
Navigator’s hitting short, he received tremendously
left and right from Harmer, and
was ultimately floored. (This changed the
betting again, and seven to four was sported
upon Harry.)</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—The blows upon both sides were so
hard and fast as not to be described. It was
a long round, and Harmer went down rather
distressed.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The time appeared to be called rather
too quick for both men, as both showed
symptoms of distress. Some sparring occurred,
when Shelton was missing in an
instant: he received a blow under his left
ear, and he appeared stunned, lying on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—It was astonishing to see with what
pluck Shelton again met his man. Another
desperate rally took place, at the end of
which Shelton went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Some good blows exchanged, and
both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—The Navigator was on the grass from
a slight hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—A short round, and Shelton thrown
cleanly by his adversary.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Both the combatants were no strangers
to the hammering they had received.
However, they got into work, and desperation
seemed the order of the round. Harmer
manfully strove to take out the fight of his
opponent, while the latter seemed to have
that precise object in view. It was hard
work on both sides; but the round closed to
the advantage of Shelton, who sent Harmer
down. The head of the latter unfortunately,
in falling, came in contact with a stake.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—The appearance of Harmer was
against him on coming to the scratch; and
none but an extraordinary man could have
returned so quickly to have commenced the
round. His right hand appeared also to
have given way, and some alarm was felt
from this circumstance. Harmer went down
from a slight hit. The backers of Harry were
rather puzzled, and the partizans of Shelton
now boldly offered six to four upon him.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>15.—Affairs were materially changed.
Shelton was now decidedly the favourite;
he again sent Harmer down.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Harmer was still in the back ground,
notwithstanding he exerted himself to change
this unfortunate aspect. Shelton again had
it his own way, and Harry went down from
a slight blow. The friends of Shelton looked
upon victory as a matter of course, and
betted seven to four without hesitation;
many still greater odds.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—This round, to all appearance, seemed
to have decided the fight. A rally took
place, but Shelton was quite a hero in it;
he planted blows in all directions, and, from
a dreadful one that Harmer received on his
nob, he was floored in a twinkling. (Five
to one upon Shelton.)</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Harmer came up to the scratch in a
tottering state. He merely placed himself
in a fighting position, but was soon sent
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>19 to 21.—The game exhibited by Harmer
under these circumstances astonished every
one present. In all these rounds he seemed
bewildered, and the advice of his seconds
lost upon him. It was all against him, and
in the twenty-first round Shelton was so
much the superior man, that Harmer was
hit out of the ring. (The odds were now so
great, and the termination of the battle considered
so certain in favour of Shelton, that
no takers were to be found.)</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—Harmer came almost reeling to meet
his man. It was desperation in the extreme,
or, in the bold language of the hero of Bosworth
Field,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c028'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have set my life upon a cast,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I will stand the hazard of the die.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>It was thought next to an impossibility that
Harmer could last a round longer; but such
is the uncertainty of battle, that he made a
tolerable bout of it, and also had the good
fortune to hit his opponent down. The surprise
this circumstance occasioned cannot be
described; even betting was the fact.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Harmer appeared first upon his legs,
and, strange to state, so sudden was the falling
off of the Navigator that, on being
brought to face his man, he seemed insensible
to every object around him. Harmer
hit him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Considering the exhausted state of
both the combatants, this might be considered
a good round. The Navigator seemed
to recollect himself, and ultimately sent
down Harmer. (Shelton was again the
favourite, and seven to four against his opponent
was viewed as safe betting.)</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Harmer still persevered, in spite of
all obstacles, and from the advantage of
giving Shelton a dreadful cross-buttock,
victory turned in his favour. The fall was
so heavy that the breath seemed to be all
shaken out of the Navigator, and one of his
shoulders received a violent contusion.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—Shelton was completely stupefied
from the effects of the last round, and Harry
merely pushed him down. (The odds now
rapidly changed again, and Harmer for anything.)</p>

<p class='c022'>27, 28, and last.—The Navigator was all
but done, and a blow from Harmer on the
side of his head put a period to the contest,
which was decidedly finished in thirty-five
minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—It was impossible for superior
courage to have been shown in any battle
whatever than in this between Harmer and
Shelton; a more truly sporting fight was
never witnessed. It is true the amateurs
felt some degree of surprise at the sudden
falling off of the Navigator; but Harmer
raised his fame from his manly conduct, and
only won the battle from his unbounded
game and perseverance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Harmer, shortly after the above combat, in company with Fuller, crossed
the water, in order to give the natives of France some practical ideas on the
national sport of English boxing, and were liberally received. Their efforts
were thus delicately announced in the French papers:—“Two English boxers
have already given several representations in the Rue Neuve des Petits
Champs. Persons of the most refined sensibility may be present, for these
boxers do not strike so as to do each other any injury. In England, after
every battle, one or two of the assailants must be declared <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</span></i>, and
when they are obliged to carry him off the field in a wheel-barrow or on a
shutter the pleasure is complete. At Paris we are not so greedy: we content
ourselves with a few blows, and the demonstration of them is enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Harmer set-to with Fuller upon a stage erected on the race-course, near
Montmartre, between the heats. The Duke of Wellington was one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>spectators upon this occasion, and ordered five Napoleons to be put into the
hat. This was shortly after the occupation of Paris by the allied sovereigns,
and a number of distinguished characters belonging to various nations
attended. At some of the minor theatres in Paris the sparring of these
boxers not only contributed to fill up the ballet of action, but was loudly
applauded. The liberality of Monsieur, however, was far behind the contributions
of the amateurs at Moulsey. One lively instance presents itself.
An English officer, a Captain of the Guards, went round to the spectators on
the race-course with a hat, to collect subscriptions for Harmer and Fuller,
and upon coming up to a fashionably dressed Frenchman, he generously
threw in a single sous. The officer, by way of a set-off for the liberal donation,
immediately held it up in his hand and, walking round the stage,
exclaimed, “Behold this very handsome present given by a French gentleman!”
This <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouvelle</span></i> mode of ridicule had the desired effect, and the
Frenchman, not possessing nerve enough to encounter such an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exposé</span></i>,
instantly took the hint and galloped off the ground, amidst the shouts and
laughter of the assemblage, which was a complete mixture of English,
French, Austrians, Prussians, Russians, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the conflict of opinion respecting the battle between Harmer and
Shelton, the friends of the latter were induced to give him another chance.
He was accordingly backed to fight Harmer, on the 26th of June, 1816;
but Shelton, during his training, fell off altogether in constitution, and paid
forfeit.</p>

<p class='c007'>In December, 1817, Harmer’s ring career was ended by a severe ophthalmic
disorder, which so affected his eyesight as to compel him to decline all
challenges. As Harry had never been defeated, he was the object of some
envy. He began business as a publican at the Plough, in West Smithfield,
which he kept for many years. Shelton, having called at Harmer’s and
quarrelled with him, he thereafter published a challenge, to which Harmer
sent the following reply:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c010'>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—</div>

  <h4 class='c016'>HENRY JOSIAH HOLT, THE CICERO OF THE RING—1816‒1820</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Harry Holt was born at Islington on the 17th of May, 1792. In early
life he was articled to a surveyor, but his master having failed, he was
turned over for the remainder of his apprenticeship to a builder, in St.
Martin’s Lane. Here he seems to have imbibed a love of “arms,” and,
disdaining the jog-trot operations of the plane and saw, he appears to have
determined to chisel his way through life in a more exciting path. That
this resolution was prudent we are by no means disposed to believe, but
“every one to his taste,” as the old woman said when she kissed her cow;
and if he was unable to build for himself a fame equal to Sir Christopher
Wren, he at least obtained a fame in other respects which, to the day of
his death, made him acceptable in the eyes of the fancy circles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon all occasions in the prize ring he evinced a tact and gallantry which
obtained for him well-earned commendations; and his literary ability for
some time made him the support of the milling department of the second
sporting paper of the kingdom, the <em>Era</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first recorded conflict in which Harry Holt engaged was with a
hero of the trowel, in the Five Fields, Chelsea, in the year 1810. His opponent
was well known in the neighbourhood as a determined miller, and
flattered himself he could dispose of the pretensions of the slight and fair-haired
youth without giving him half a chance. But the science and quickness
of Harry turned the scale, and he not only astonished the bricklayer,
but carried off the laurel of victory in triumphant style. His next trial was
with a life-guardsman (as recorded in “Boxiana”), and here again, despite
the disparity of height and weight, Harry milled the swordsman till he laid
down his arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The skirmishes of Holt ere he was out of his teens will be found related in
“Boxiana,” vol. iii., pp. 372‒5, in the usual loose, skimble-skamble, ungrammatical
style of the uneducated editor of that undigested hotch-potch.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the age of twenty-five Harry first shied his castor within the twenty-four
feet ring (so called, upon the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lucus a non lucendo</span></i> principle, from its shape
being a parallelogram), on the 20th of August, 1816, with Joe Parish, the
waterman. This was indeed a manly, as well as a scientific, contest; and,
although defeated, Holt earned “golden opinions” from all those whose good
opinion was worth having. The victory was gamely disputed for ninety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>minutes, during which seventy rounds were fought. At the commencement
Holt was thought to have the advantage, but the tide of fortune soon
changed, and he “got into trouble,” out of which he never again was able
to struggle. On one occasion during the fight Parish had Holt upon the
ropes, in a position where he might in all probability have “finished” him,
but he manfully threw up his hands and walked away, amidst loud and well-merited
approbation from all parts of the ring. Holt felt so impressed with
this generous behaviour of his adversary, that while his adversary sat upon
his second’s knee, he shook him by the hand, saying, “I thank you, Joe, for
your conduct.” After an hour and ten minutes, the termination seemed
extremely doubtful, when Parish, like a true aquatic, watching the turn of
the “tide which leads to fortune,” went in so strongly and determinedly that
poor Harry, despite the most heroic efforts, was forced to succumb, and was
led from the ring completely beaten. The result of this contest raised both
men in the esteem of the milling circles, and Parish (this was his first
appearance in the prize ring) was shortly after matched against the Nonpareil,
Jack Randall, who, we need hardly say, in turn defeated the victor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holt now devoted some nine months to sparring, and acquiring a still
further knowledge of his art. His manners were pleasing, his address
engaging, and, as he sung a song somewhat above mediocrity, his company
was sought, a dangerous thing for a young man in the great metropolis.
Harry, too, from having received an education somewhat above the average
of the society with which he mixed, and being moreover gifted with a command
of words and a power of expression rather beyond the ordinary range,
was generally elected to address the public on the occasion of benefits, etc.,
by such of his brother pugs who were “slow and halt of speech,” a deficiency
to which those readiest with hands and feet are often doomed. From
these oratorical displays, he soon acquired the sobriquet of “Cicero,” and, as
the Cicero of the ring, Harry Holt for some quarter of a century figured in
the public prints.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holt’s next appearance in the prize ring was with Jack O’Donnell (said to
be a relative of the once celebrated Irish pugilist of that name), at Arlington
Corner, near Hounslow Heath, after a harassing journey of some miles across
the country, in consequence of the interruption which took place on the day
the first fight between Scroggins and Turner occurred, at Hayes, Middlesex.
This was on Wednesday, March 26, 1817. The combatants stripped in a
heavy shower of rain, and commenced fighting at a quarter before six o’clock
in the evening. Tom Owen and Dolly Smith seconded O’Donnell; and
Painter and Harmer attended upon Holt. Five to four on the latter.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Upon setting-to the attitude
of Holt was extremely elegant, and his appearance
altogether rather interested the
spectators in his behalf. He commenced
play without ceremony, by planting a severe
facer under O’Donnell’s left eye, and got
away with much dexterity. The latter endeavoured
to return the compliment, but hit
short. It was one of the most manly rounds
ever witnessed, the men fighting at arm’s
length; and, notwithstanding the rain descended
in torrents, the combatants seemed
insensible to its chilling effects, and opposed
each other with the utmost gaiety. A number
of good blows passed between them,
materially to the advantage of Holt, who
nobbed poor Paddy most successfully. Near
ten minutes had elapsed, nothing like closing
had occurred, and both appeared quite
exhausted, when O’Donnell rushed in, and
Holt was sent down. Such a first round
was scarcely ever seen before. (Seven to
four on Holt.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—O’Donnell, finding that keeping out
from his opponent was disadvantageous, endeavoured
to bore in, but Holt stopped him
by a tremendous blow on the jaw, that made
his pimple rattle again. The Irishman was
not to be dismayed, and he succeeded in
marking one of Holt’s peepers. Some
reciprocal fighting took place, when, in a
struggle to obtain the throw, both went
down, but Holt undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Holt hit and stopped with great facility,
and his science was loudly admired
throughout the ring. O’Donnell did not
want for courage, and showed himself to
much advantage in this round. A desperate
rally took place, and in closing, O’Donnell
endeavoured to fib Holt, but the latter resolutely
broke away, and knocked O’Donnell’s
head about like a spinning top. Both ultimately
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—A smile sat upon the countenance of
Holt: he had all the coolness about his
actions of the experienced pugilist, and he
scarcely threw a blow away. O’Donnell’s
mug, from the repeated attacks made upon
it, appeared rather out of shape. Both again
down. (Two to one upon Holt.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5 to 17 and last.—It was most manly
boxing throughout the whole of these rounds.
O’Donnell put in some good hits, and always
had the best of his opponent in throwing,
but he never could keep his head out of
chancery. The seventeenth round was truly
desperate. O’Donnell repeatedly attempted
to go in, but was as repeatedly kept out by a
stopper on his nob. Holt put in six facers
without any return. The jaw of O’Donnell
was terribly battered, part of his chin laid
open, and a tremendous blow, put in under
his ear, brought out the claret instantaneously,
and his senses seemed almost beat out
of him. He could not come again.</p>

<p class='c022'>Mr. Jackson made a collection of £9 to
be divided between them. This battle proved
a treat to the admirers of scientific boxing;
so good a fight restored good humour to the
amateurs for their disappointment at Hayes;
and they retired well satisfied. The ring was
kept in good order, although neither ropes
nor stakes were used to protect the men
from the crowd. The unpropitious state of
the weather had not the least effect upon
the feelings of the spectators, who never
shifted an inch of ground in consequence of
being so drippingly assailed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The friends of Holt, from his decisive victory over O’Donnell, and the
general improvement which had taken place in his fighting, were induced to
match him with a better man, and, on the 20th of May, 1817, the sporting
world was on the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</span></i> to witness the decision of the match between
Harry Holt and the Nonpareil of the ring, the celebrated Jack Randall, who
long preceded the subject of this sketch in his journey “to that bourne from
whence no traveller returns.” Indeed, the friends of Holt and many of the
most distinguished amateurs were much prepossessed in his favour, and, notwithstanding
the known excellence of Randall, it was very generally thought
that Holt would prove a worthy competitor. Coombe Warren was the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus
in quo</span></i>, and, on the appointed Wednesday, Colonel Berkeley (the late Earl),
Captain Barclay, Mr. Jackson, and a muster of Corinthian patrons of popular
sports, assembled at the above-named place. The combatants were equal in
weight and height, namely, each about five feet six inches and a half, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>ten stone two pounds to four pounds. Randall was backed by his patron
Colonel Barton, and Holt by several amateurs of eminence. The stake was
£50. This battle will be found in the Life of <span class='sc'>Randall</span>, p. 332.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was urged by many of Holt’s friends that he displayed no fight at all
in this contest with Randall; but this complaint will vanish on a slight
examination. Randall assumed the offensive throughout the battle, and his
punishment was so electrifying and severe that he never gave Holt any opportunity
of showing himself, save in the defensive department of fistic strategy.
Holt did, in the earlier part of the battle, occasionally stop his opponent’s
left; but the fact was, as Holt frequently afterwards observed, the fight was
decisively hit out of him in the third round. Indeed, if Holt had not been
a truly game man, he never could have stood before Randall twenty-five
minutes, after the heavy milling he received at the outset, and in consequence
of this opinion a few amateurs present collected £10, which they
presented to him as the reward of his bravery.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the battle between Turner and Cy. Davis at Wallingham Common,
on Friday, June 18, 1819, a cessation of hostilities for upwards of an hour
took place, during which period a purse was subscribed, but went begging
for want of a couple of good ones. Sutton, the black, who had defeated the
brave Ned Painter, wished to have a shy at Carter (once the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</span></i> Champion
of England), but the latter boxer pleaded indisposition. Hall, Jack
Martin (the Master of the Rolls), and others were named, but it was “no
go.” At length Harry Holt, to adjust all difficulties, shied his castor into
the arena for any ten stone man, declaring (unlike our cavilling pugilists,
“those of the modern time”) that he was not nice to a few pounds. His
challenge was speedily accepted by David Hudson. Randall and O’Donnell
waited on Holt, and Josh. Hudson and Tom Owen upon David Hudson.
The purse was 20 guineas, and the odds on Holt five to four.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “game” of Holt had been proved on more than one occasion, and his
character stood high as a neat stopper, a pretty rapid hitter, and a well-scienced
man. He was not, however, by any means in condition, and had
walked all the way from London that morning to see the first fight. Hudson,
too, was out of condition; nevertheless, they set-to with a spirit which might
put to the blush mills of far higher pretence and more careful and expensive
preparation, Holt taking the lead, and nobbing Hudson down.</p>

<p class='c007'>Harry contested this battle up to the eighty-ninth round, but he could not
stand the hitting of Hudson, and went down repeatedly; while, on the
contrary, Hudson seemed to be getting fresher, and often ran and jumped to
get in at Holt. The latter would not give in, and he was taken out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>ring by the desire of a noble lord and other amateurs. The fight occupied
an hour and three-quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a most distinguished, capital fight on both sides, and, in a word,
the men covered themselves with pugilistic glory. Holt was rather too stale
for his opponent; he had also some of his teeth dislodged. A handsome
subscription was made for Holt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holt now bade adieu to the ring, in which, if he had not done what
Addison declares is not within the power of mortals, namely, “command
success,” he had done more, “deserved it.” Time, however, and the Fates
brought round another scrimmage in the shape of a room fight, with the
never-to-be-forgotten Jack Scroggins, whose “ghost” long “revisited the
pale glimpses of the moon” in the poetic gaggeries of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 30th of November, 1820, after a sporting dinner at Randall’s house
in Chancery Lane, there arose a difference of opinion during a discussion of
the merits of various pugilistic professors. Spring, Purcell, Randall, Martin,
the Birmingham Youth, Holt, etc., being among the parties assembled.
Among matches proposed and talked of, was one between Holt and Scroggins,
to come off in some six weeks from the first “time of asking.” This delay,
however, the time being eleven o’clock at night, and the spirits mounting,
did not suit the desperate Scroggy, who delivered his ideas on the subject
somewhat in the following form:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, as to that there matter, it ain’t no match between me and Holt;
I can lick him like a babby. I never was so ill with a cold in my life; but
I will fight him any time you like, but I’d rather it ’ud be now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Holt returned Scroggins thanks for his candour, but, in return, thought
Scroggins would have no chance to win with him. Nevertheless, he too was
of opinion that the best way would be to decide it instantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am ready,” said Scroggins; “but the winner shall have the whole of
the purse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am agreeable,” replied Holt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The usual preparations were made for the contest. Turner and Martin
seconded Scroggins, and Purcell and Sampson were for Holt. Spring was
the time-keeper. Five to four on Scroggins on one side of the room, and
five to four on Holt among the other party.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this affair Holt, after taking the lead in scientific style, received a
heavy fall from Scroggy’s rush in the twenty-fourth round; up to that
period Scroggy had all the worst of it. Harry’s constitution, however, could
not stand the wear and tear, and, after thirty-three rounds, Sampson declared
Holt should fight no more.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>For two men out of condition, nay, both unwell, particularly Scroggins, it
was a much better fight than has frequently been seen when boxers have
been in training for six weeks. Scroggins had always some tremendous
points about him. It was a most gallant battle on both sides; but the blows
of Holt were not hard enough to stop the rush of Scroggins. The accident
Holt received in the twenty-fourth round lost him the fight; and he also
complained of a sprained thumb before he commenced the battle. In a ring,
some of the amateurs thought Holt might have had a better chance. The
smiles of victory, which had not been familiar to Scroggins in his last six
battles, now seemed to give him new life. He was, however, in the most
exhausted state; and nothing but a lack of the <em>physique</em> to second his science
and courage made Harry the loser of this most determined contest.</p>

<p class='c007'>We here drop the curtain on the pugilistic career of Harry Holt, whereon,
although the sunshine of victory seldom shone, he ever displayed, under the
clouds of misfortune and ill-success, the brightest attributes of a British boxer,
science, courage, self-possession, and honesty. “Some one must lose,” as a
practical philosopher has remarked, and the mischances of war fell often and
heavily on poor Harry. Henceforth his career was chequered and various in
its character, sometimes basking in the sunshine of Dame Fortune, and at
others reposing in the shade of her elder daughter, and tasting the bitters of
vicissitude. He became publican, whether a “sinner” or not we will not
take upon ourselves to state; but, as far as our experience has gone, the traits
of his character were quite as estimable as any of those in whose sphere he
moved. His early education enabled him to bring into useful operation the
powers of his pen, and upon the retirement of Pierce Egan from the <cite>Dispatch</cite>,
he was engaged by Alderman Harmer as the mentor of Mr. Smith, the new
milling editor of that paper, now, like Harry, gone to that bourne from
which no pugilist returns. Harry was found an excellent Asmodeus to
Smith, and introduced him to all the eccentricities of London life, as well as
to the mysteries of the London Ring, and found so apt a pupil that his
<em>protegé</em> was soon enabled to go alone, and to obtain for the <cite>Dispatch</cite> a reputation
for its advocacy of the sports of the ring, which it has long since lost,
and which lies buried in the tomb of poor Smith. As a second in the ring,
with his consummate judgment and “artful dodging,” Harry was only
equalled by Tom Belcher and Dick Curtis; and these three men were always
considered hosts of themselves in doubtful points, for, by their ingenious
devices and careful husbanding the strength of their principals, they have
frequently “brought their men through,” when the balance preponderated
against them. In the course of his life Harry occasionally dealt in cigars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>and other “Parliament” commodities, and thus did his duty manfully for the
support of a large family. He latterly devoted himself entirely to sporting
literature, and proved himself a useful assistant to the <em>Era</em> newspaper, in
recording milling and pedestrian occurrences, always reporting faithfully and
impartially, and displaying a knowledge of his profession, eminently useful
in describing the “ins and outs” and “ups and downs” of a fight. His
inevitable exposure in this vocation to the change of weather in every season
of the year, whether on the land or the water, now sitting for three or four
hours up to his fetlocks in snow or mud in a slimy marsh, and then scorched
by the rays of a mid-day sun, and again at night breathing the fœtid atmosphere
of some fancy “re-union,” gradually operated upon a constitution
injured by early exertion, seized his lungs, and threw him into a rapid
decline. His last appearance in the discharge of his vocation was at the
fight between Heffernan and Scully, in the Marshes of Kent, on Tuesday,
April 9, 1844, to and from which he was conveyed with great difficulty to
the steamer, and thence home. While committing to paper the result of
his observations, he received his last awful summons from “the grim king
of terrors,” and handing his pen to his son, left him to give the finishing
stroke to his report. He left behind him a widow and six children, one
of whom, Alfred, succeeded to his father’s post of Ring reporter, firstly on
the <em>Era</em>, and subsequently on a daily journal.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c009'><sup>[167]</sup></a> Holt was eminently known
among his compeers for his “gift of the gab,” as it is vulgarly termed, hence
his cognomen of “Cicero,” the speechmaking at benefits, etc., being entrusted
to his care.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would that he had left behind a goodly number of men in his profession,
who, without his talents, were imbued with an equal share of honesty of
purpose, integrity of conduct, and correctness in all the relations of life, both
public and private; were such the case, the position of British boxers
would not be degraded to the low ebb at which it stands at present. Highly
respected by the patrons of the science of self-defence, and esteemed by many
of the right sort yet remaining, his compeers in the ring, Harry Holt left
behind him a name which may be envied by many of his fraternity who less
deserve it.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>WEST COUNTRY DICK, THE NAVIGATOR.—1816‒1820.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A more manly and courageous boxer was not to be found among the
records of pugilism than this little hero. In a short period he fought no less
than sixteen prize battles in gallant style, and the smiles of victory proved
propitious to his exertions in twelve, Curtis, Gipsy Cooper, and Jack Randall
ranking among his conquerors; defeat by such men being no dishonour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Richard West was a native of Bedminster, in Somersetshire, and was born
in the year 1794. At the period of his first battle he was in height five feet
five inches and a half, and weighed nine stone and half a pound. Dick
ranked more as an active boxer than a fine fighter, and was conspicuous for
being a slashing hitter; considering his weight, he certainly used his right
in a tremendous manner. His courage was of so superior a quality that
it often prompted him to fight men much above his own weight. The most
prominent of Dick’s battles were the following:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick’s first attempt at prize milling was with a man denominated the
Grabbler, in Tothill Fields. It was a desperate fight, and one hour and
twenty minutes expired before Dick was declared conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>A man of the name of Reeve was disposed of by Dick in the short space of
six minutes, at Coombe Wood. It was a match for seven guineas a-side,
Dick putting down his own stake.</p>

<p class='c007'>A gardener, of good weight, fought with Dick at Moulsey Hurst. This
was also a short battle; and, as before, the confidence of Dick again prompted
him to back himself. He gained the victory in good style.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick next entered the lists with the determined Jack Curtis, whose fatal
termination of his fight with Turner we have already noticed in that boxer’s
life. Dick was defeated in fifty-eight minutes, his right hand being disabled
by an accident.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a trifling purse, to make up a second fight after Carter had defeated
Robinson, the man of colour, in a match against time, at Coombe Warren, on
Wednesday, June 26, 1816, Dick entered the ring with Jack Payne, the
butcher, but, in the course of only four rounds, the latter was so satisfied
that he declared he would fight no more, and left the ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick was at length matched with Charley Martin for the sum of 20 guineas
a-side. This contest took place at Moulsey Hurst on Tuesday, August 22,
1816. It was a spirited battle on both sides, and reciprocal milling occurred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>during forty-seven rounds; but the severity of Dick’s hitting brought him
through in fifty minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Martin, not exactly satisfied as to the merits of the above battle, requested
a second trial of skill, which being granted, he entered the ring with Dick,
confident of recovering his lost laurels, on Thursday, February 13, 1817, at
Coombe Warren, for 20 guineas a-side. Richmond and Eales seconded
Martin, and Dick had for his attendants Oliver and Clarke. This second
encounter was bravely contested for thirty-four rounds; and sharper milling,
for the time it lasted, thirty-five minutes, had not been often seen; for the
last six rounds Martin had not the least chance, and left the ring much
punished. The Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia, the late autocrat of that
mighty empire, who witnessed this battle, seemed much interested in the
event, and made many remarks upon the courage displayed by both boxers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick was now thought a competent match for the Nonpareil, Jack Randall,
who defeated him in thirty-three rounds. See <span class='sc'>Randall</span>, p. 330.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make up for a wretched burlesque on scientific pugilism, which took
place on Tuesday, December 23, 1817, at Coventry Farm, on the Hale,
Middlesex, Dick was suddenly called upon to enter the ring with Street, for
a subscription purse of 10 guineas. No delay occurred, and Dick, attended
by his seconds, Paddington Jones and Ballard, and Street by Dolly Smith
and Lancaster, appeared within the ropes at thirteen minutes to three o’clock,
and fought as follows:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Dick’s right hand soon got into
work, and slightly nobbed his opponent.
Street, in returning, hit short. They immediately
fought their way into a close, and
both went down. (Six to four on Dick.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Dick, as usual, full of bustle, put in a
severe facer that made Street’s head shake
again; the latter, with much confidence,
stuck close to Dick, and gave him a sharp
blow on the shoulder. In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Street, on setting-to, planted a heavy
hit under Dick’s ear and got away, laughing
and nodding, by way of self-approbation.
Some hits were exchanged and both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Street made play with his left hand
and got away. Hard fighting soon commenced,
when Dick, with spirit and judgment,
drove his opponent to the ropes, and
hit him clean out of the ring. (Great applause.
Seven to four against Street.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Street met his man confidently, but
his blows, though often well directed, lost
their force from being open-handed; the
best of the hitting was on the side of Dick.
In closing, both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Dick went down from a hit under his
left arm; but it appeared more owing to the
slippery state of the ground than the force
of the blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>7 and 8.—In the latter round Dick took
the lead in good style, hit his opponent quite
away from him, and followed him with success,
making several blows tell, till both
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Street did not turn out quite so easy a
customer as Dick had imagined. The nob
of the former was rather the worse for the
battle; but no claret was to be seen about
either. Could Dick have used his left hand
with any sort of effect, he might have made
greater progress towards conquest. This
was a milling round, and both down in the
close.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Dick was rather distressed from his
exertions in the last round, and seemed
rather slow in quitting his second’s knee,
which excited much vociferation of “Time,
time,” from Lancaster. Paddington Jones
was angry at this, and offered to fight the
former for his uncalled-for noise. When at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>the scratch some sharp hits were exchanged,
and Street went down from the severity of
his opponent’s right hand. (Two to one on
Dick.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Street, it was evident, could not protect
his head from repeated facers; but he
planted a sharp body blow that moved Dick
from his station. The ground was in such a
wet clayey state that neither of the combatants
could stand firm. However, Dick sent
Street down in a twinkling. (“Bravo,
Dick!” and five to two was offered.)</p>

<p class='c022'>12 to 15.—In the latter round Street hit
his opponent down, and planted so severe a
blow on one of Dick’s peepers that made it
wink again. Street felt flattered at this
event, and clapped his hands at Dick while
on the knee of his second.</p>

<p class='c022'>16 and 17.—Dick slipped down from a
slight hit; he was evidently distressed.
Oliver handed the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau de vie</span></i> to his seconds,
who instantly administered the restorative
cordial.</p>

<p class='c022'>18 to 20.—In all these rounds Street appeared
the fresher, though his opponent had
rather the best of the milling. Dick’s eye
was puffed up and seemed dark, and Street
anxiously endeavoured to shut up the other.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Street came to the scratch laughing
and nodding at Dick by way of derision; but
the latter gave him such a podger on the
jaw that not only spoiled the grin on his
countenance, but made him laugh on the
wrong side of his mouth. He finished the
round by hitting him down.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—Dick seemed to have recovered and
reduced Street to his pitch; he made his
hits tell as fast as he could plant them.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—The scale was now turning, Dick
having it all his own way. He planted four
severe facers without any return, and ultimately
sent Street down. (Five to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>24 to 27.—In these rounds Street scarcely
exchanged a blow before he was in the
mud.</p>

<p class='c022'>28 to 32.—It was all up with Street; he
was down every round. Dick very politely
inquired how he felt himself?</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—Street, on leaving the knee of his
second, was asked by Dick “To come to his
place, and stand up like a man;” but he was
again down, as soon as Dick stepped towards
him.</p>

<p class='c022'>34 and last.—On setting-to, Street almost
laid himself down. He, however, got on
his legs, but seemed to avoid meeting his
man, and so the fight ended in thirty-one
minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Considering that the above
contest was a made up mill on the spur of
the moment, it was far above mediocrity,
although there was more manhood than
science displayed. The combatants, too, it
seems, were equally unprepared for the
event, Dick having been “navigating” early
in the morning, and “padded the hoof,” as
it was termed in what Ephemera calls the
“faded flash era,” down to the Hale. Street
also had pedestrianised it from Woolwich to
the same spot, a distance of twenty-two
miles, which must have operated as a considerable
drawback upon activity. Dick’s
mug was rather battered; and had not the
frame of Street been of a close texture, the
repeated punishment he received would have
been much more visible. The latter, though
defeated, was not altogether satisfied with
the termination of the fight; and it was
thought not unlikely, at a future period, it
might lead to a more regular meeting. Dick
was now not above nine stone and half a
pound, and declared himself open to any
man under ten stone weight in the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c013'>Colonel Barton and several amateurs of rank appeared on the ground.
Randall, Parish, Scroggins, Oliver, Gibbons, Tom Belcher, etc., were also
present.</p>

<p class='c007'>A match was now proposed to Dick to enter the lists again with Jack, the
butcher. Our game little hero accepted the challenge without hesitation,
and on Tuesday, February 2, 1818, upwards of eight thousand persons
assembled on Old Oak Common, Middlesex, to witness the battle. The fight
was for 20 guineas a-side, in a twenty-four feet roped ring. From the size,
strength, and weight of the knight of the cleaver (added to his promise of
fighting like a man for once in his lifetime), he was backed by the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</span></i>
knowing ones at six to four; but the steady amateurs who valued character,
who admired pluck, and who were well assured that while a chance remained
Dick would not quit the field, took the odds again and again as a safe thing.
The event justified their judgment. At thirteen minutes past one o’clock,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>Dick, accompanied by his seconds, Randall and Paddington Jones, entered
the ring and threw up his hat. Payne soon followed and answered the token
of defiance, attended by the veteran Joe Ward and Dick Whale. The good
old ceremony of shaking hands was then gone through, and the combat
commenced.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Jack set-to rather eagerly, but
hit short, when Dick’s right hand made free
with his opponent’s nob. In closing, Jack
endeavoured to fib West, but both went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Jack seemed to feel as if he had still
some character left, and endeavoured to convince
the amateurs that he could fight. He
gave Dick a precious muzzler, and exchanged
some sharp hits; but when Dick put in a
facer which produced the claret, a slight
trait of his old system peeped out, and he
went down not in the most gallant style.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—This was a good round, and two
minutes of downright milling occurred.
Jack put in two desperate facers with much
dexterity, and likewise some sharp body
hits. Dick was not behindhand with his
opponent, and exchanged hits in a manly
style till he sent Payne down.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Payne hit his adversary till Dick got
the turn, when he followed the butcher all
over the ring; the latter’s mug was bleeding
copiously. Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Sharp work was the order of this
round, and reciprocal nobbers occurred. In
closing, Dick threw his adversary.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Dick evidently took the lead, although
he did not escape severe punishment. Payne
went down from a heavy hit he received on
his body; he fell on his knees, and his nob
bent forward on the ground in a singular
manner.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—After an exchange of blows Jack
curred it down from a facer. (“He’s coming
it!” and disapprobation.)</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Dick went down from the force of his
own blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—This round raised a blush upon the
cheeks of the game pugilists who witnessed
the fight. A boxer, at least twenty pounds
heavier, and taller, than his antagonist, positively
turned his back and ran away from a
nine stone man, after receiving a few sharp
hits, and in a manner laid himself down.
(Loud hissing.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—It was singular to observe how, when
the butcher forgot his fears, he fought in
manly style. In this round Jack had decidedly
the best of the milling: he planted
two facers right and left, and sent Dick
down from a bodier. The latter, while on
his second’s knee, appeared much exhausted,
and brandy was applied with success.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Jack again took the lead: he planted
two dreadful hits right and left on Dick’s
nob that seemed nearly to stupefy him; but
Dick, game-cock like, went in with the most
determined confidence, changed the scene,
and the butcher rolled down from a hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—After an exchange of hits, Dick sent
his opponent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Dick slipped down on one knee, but
recovered himself, and ultimately got his
adversary down.</p>

<p class='c022'>14 and 15.—Jack was down in both these
rounds, but not before Dick had received
much mischief.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Dick again slipped; but recovering
himself to meet his antagonist, received a
desperate blow near the mark that floored
him. This was bad judgment on the part of
Dick.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—This was a singular round: both
went down from counter hits.</p>

<p class='c022'>18 to 20.—One of Dick’s peepers was
nearly closed, and although he had not lost
a single drop of claret, he had received an
unusual degree of punishment. These rounds
were rather in favour of Dick.</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—This was a grand round on the part
of the little one. He planted three facers
with his right hand without return; but
Jack at length got into work, and fought
gaily till he went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>22 and 23.—Jack down in both these
rounds; in the latter he received so severe a
facer that he crimsoned all over in a twinkling.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—The butcher again administered some
heavy punishment. In closing, both down,
when Jack laughed at his antagonist.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Jack went down from a hit in the
throat. (“Well done, Dick!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—There was nothing like stopping
attempted between the combatants; and
several of the round lunging blows told
desperately. Dick again received some terrible
punishment about his nob that made
him stagger. Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—Dick was now extremely weak, and
his nob had been so peppered that he could
scarcely tell what he was about; but his
natural game prompted him to proceed, and
in consequence he floored Jack from a desperate
hit on his mouth. (Loud shouting.)</p>

<p class='c022'>28 to 30.—Although Payne curred it down
in all these rounds, it could not be considered
exactly safe to Dick. The butcher
always hit his opponent. In the last round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>the hats were thrown up, in consequence of
Jack’s not liking to leave his second’s knee.
(Five to one on Dick.)</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—The butcher slowly appeared at the
scratch, and the terrible long faces of his
backers resumed a more cheerful appearance
at the chance. He fought this round tolerably
well, and, in closing, when Dick attempted
to fib him, held his hands till both
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—On setting-to, Jack fell down. (Hissing.)</p>

<p class='c022'>33 to 37 and last.—In all these rounds the
butcher went down in a currish style, although
he generally planted a hit before he fell.
He could not have lost it had he possessed
anything like the heart of a true English
boxer. Thirty-five minutes and ten seconds
had elapsed, when victory was decided in
favour of Dick. The latter was led out of
the ring almost deprived of vision; and Jack
leant across the ropes to show, as usual, that
he was quite sick of it. It, however, cannot
be denied that he took a good share of milling,
and was heavily hit about the loins.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Notwithstanding Dick’s well-known
bottom, it was physically impossible
he could have lasted three rounds more.
Nature was completely exhausted by the
heavy punishment he had received. Upon
Dick s being put into a coach he was for a
short period stupefied, which might have
been owing to the heavy nobbing hits he
had undergone; and, in consequence of not
losing a single drop of blood, his head was
much swelled. Had Dick been anything
but a game cock, he could never have had
the pluck to have fought a man twenty-three
pounds heavier than himself, and in
every respect a more skilful boxer. Upon
the whole, it was not a contemptible fight.
In this instance it was admitted that the
butcher “did the thing that was right,”
and was defeated against his will. In a
word, he was a boxer without “a heart,”
and it was a matter of great astonishment
how the amateurs could have suffered him
again to make his appearance in the prize
ring, after his unblushing effrontery in previously
acknowledging his being privy to a
cross. His backers, it was said, lost considerable
sums in consequence of his defeat.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dick was matched with David Hudson, for 50 guineas a-side; but he
was defeated, to the great surprise and mortification of his friends, in a few
minutes. See <span class='sc'>David Hudson</span>, Appendix, Period VI.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Friday, September 11, 1818, Dick, for a purse of 20 guineas, fought
with Davis, a navigator, belonging to the Chatham Dockyard, in a field near
the Chatham Lines. For the first twelve rounds it was tremendous punishment
and reciprocal fighting; but in the thirteenth round Davis dislocated
his wrist, which compelled him reluctantly to acknowledge Dick as the
conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abbot, who had defeated Dolly Smith, at the Barge House, in Essex, after
a long fight of 138 rounds, occupying two hours and fifty-five minutes,
it seems looked forward to greater conquests. At a sporting dinner which
took place on Tuesday, March 2, 1819, in the neighbourhood of Westminster,
several of the milling coves looked in to see if any business had been cut out
for them. Dick and Abbot, it appears, accidentally met each other, and, in
consequence of some difference of opinion, Abbot threatened to mill the
former. Dick replied with much spirit, it should not be long before he was
served out for his insolence. A purse was subscribed by the amateurs, a
large shed cleared and lighted up, and the combatants stripped, attended by
seconds and umpire, with all the regularity of a Moulsey Hurst contest.
Randall and a gentleman amateur took Dick under their especial care; and
Abbot was equally well looked after by Richmond and Hopping Ned. Dick
was terribly out of condition, much distressed, and totally unfit for fighting;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>and the state of Abbot was a few degrees removed from condition; but, it being
election time, some excuse was admitted on account of his “voting for Lushington.”
For thirty-five minutes the battle raged with manliness, activity,
and hard hitting. The left hand of Dick was seen to greater advantage than
usual, while his right dealt out tremendous punishment. Abbot was equally
on the alert, the body of Dick serving for a drum. Abbot, it is said, gave in
twice. At the expiration of an hour and ten minutes, when “time” was
called, he left his second’s knee, but so completely exhausted that he could
not put up his hands; the umpire requested Dick not to hit him in that
defenceless state, and victory was declared in his favour. Dick cross-buttocked
his opponent several times with great adroitness, but did not win
without receiving heavily, and from the manliness he displayed, and the
weight against him, he received much praise. It was three to one on Abbot
in the early part of the fight, and a great deal of betting occurred, the tens
and twenties flying about like waste paper. Dick was offered to be backed
to fight Abbot in a ring for £50 a-side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick fought a Clerkenweller of the name of Parsing, in a long but narrow
room, in the neighbourhood of Smithfield, before a few swell amateurs, for a
purse to the winner, and £1 to the loser, on Tuesday evening, June 13,
1820, at ten o’clock at night. Randall and Scroggins seconded Dick, and
Purcell and Tisdale were for Parsing. It was all over in eleven rounds,
occupying fifteen minutes. No claret was drawn. Parsing would not fight
any more, observing, Dick was too much for him in a room, but he would
fight Dick in a ring for £10 a-side of his own money. Parsing, though
much taller than Dick, had not a shadow of chance. The latter hero challenged
Tisdale to fight before he put on his clothes, as the battle just over
had not afforded any amusement to the amateurs; but Tisdale refused,
stating he should obtain no credit if he won it. “Never mind,” replied
Dick, “I’ll risk it.” Tisdale then publicly acknowledged that he did not
think himself competent to cope with Dick in a room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick fought a most tremendous battle with Jack Cooper, the Windsor
Gipsy, on Epsom Downs, May 16, 1820, but he was defeated in twenty-nine
rounds. See <span class='sc'>Gipsy Cooper</span>, Appendix, Period VI.</p>

<p class='c007'>A small subscription purse, for a second fight, at Banstead Downs, on
Tuesday, July 4, 1820, was contested for between West Country Dick and
Parsing. Dick was the favourite six to four. Parsing had been defeated by
Dick in a room, as we have just related, but flattered himself, from his
length, that he could conquer Dick in a ring. Randall and Paddington Jones
seconded the latter, and Purcell and Holt attended upon Parsing. Twenty-nine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>rounds took place, occupying twenty-eight minutes. The latter, it
appeared, could not take punishment; and the severe bodiers given to him
by Dick made him grin again. Parsing went down almost every round, and
finally surrendered.</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence of the storm having separated the amateurs rather in a
hurry at North Walsham, on Monday, July 17, at the close of Martin and
the Birmingham Youth’s battle, the fancy found themselves weather-bound
at Norwich, and in lack of amusement, when a novice of the name of
Redgreaves offered himself to the notice of a London swell for a turn-up
with Dick. It was thought Redgreaves was a yokel; but, upon further
scrutiny, it turned out that he was a Clerkenweller, and, like some others
of the milling tribe, fancied he could fight a bit, and was determined
to chance it. Dick, the game little Dick, always ready to improve his
circumstances, did not value giving a few pounds in weight to his opponent;
and, after the London manner, this battle took place in an elegant room, by
candle-light, only a few being admitted to the exhibition. At eleven o’clock
on Tuesday night, July 18, Dick stripped, Randall and Shelton taking him
under their especial care. Redgreaves was well attended by Purcell and
O’Donnell. Five to four on Dick.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Dick, without hesitation, went
to work to ascertain what sort of pluck this
new customer possessed; but Redgreaves
was not intimidated, and returned the compliment
as quickly. The result was that
Dick went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Redgreaves seemed full of fight, and a
hard hitter; exchanged blows with his adversary
in a manly manner. Dick put in a
tremendous nobbing right-handed blow, but
in a struggle was thrown.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Dick’s nob received some sharp pepper
in this round; he, nevertheless, got Redgreaves
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—A complete milling round on both
sides. Redgreaves had none the worst of it.
Both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Redgreaves got Dick under his arm
and fibbed him heavily, but the latter extricated
himself, turned round, and went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Dick missed a heavy blow, and fell.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—This was a good round. Redgreaves
showed he was a heavy hitter, and nearly
stove in Dick’s ribs. The latter gnashed his
teeth and went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Dick was thrown heavily.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Dick put in a tremendous bodier that
gave his opponent some losing notions, but
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Redgreaves came to the scratch
cruelly distressed. Randall offered a guinea
to a crown that he would not fight above
another round.</p>

<p class='c022'>11 and last.—Dick unscrewed the pepper-box,
and dealt out the punishment so hard
and so fast that Redgreaves went down, and
could not come to the scratch. It was over
in fifteen minutes. Dick got £9, and Redgreaves
£ 2 10<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> The ribs of the former were
terribly swelled. Redgreaves was not a very
easy customer, and the well-breeched yokels
pronounced it a manly fight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dick, for a small subscription purse, fought Mason (well known at the
Fives Court, for his repeated sets-to with Lennox) at Chesterfield Races, on
Thursday, July 27, 1820. Mason had not the slightest chance whatever,
and Dick was pronounced conqueror in sixteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dick entered the lists with a man of the name of Hellick, a shipwright,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>for a purse of £ 15, at Kit’s Cot House, three miles and a half from Maidstone,
on Monday, August 21, 1820. The milling fame of Dick, who had
fought nineteen prize battles, five of which occurred within the short space
of four months, attracted a numerous assemblage of persons. Hellick was a
well-known good man, upwards of a stone heavier than Dick. Bob Purcell
and Jackson handled the former; Shelton and Cooper attended upon the
latter. Dick was quite out of condition, but he was never out of pluck;
and a good battle was the result of their exertions. It occupied twenty-six
minutes, and nineteen rounds were spiritedly contested. Dick emptied the
pepper-box upon his opponent’s mug in the first fourteen rounds, and made
many severe attacks upon his victualling office; but the game of Hellick was
not to be reduced, and in the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth
rounds, Dick had it in such severe style that the shipwright, it was thought,
would come into harbour victorious; but in the nineteenth and last round,
Dick, by a sort of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grace</span></i> effort, gave Hellick a forgetter, added to a
sharp cross-buttock; he fell upon his neck, and it was all U P, to the
great mortification of the yokels, who had sported their money on the dockyard
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have met with no record of the death of this pugilist.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ABY BELASCO—1817‒1824.</h4>

<p class='c013'>During the thirty years preceding 1820, it is but candid to admit that
the Jews made a very prominent feature in the pugilistic circles; but from
the period that “Old Time” compelled Mendoza to retire from the field of
fame, and defeat and death removed Dutch Sam from the prize ring, the
glories of the children of Judah became overcast. Indeed, such men as the
two first-named were rather a disadvantage even to good ones who might
come after them. A century might elapse before two such boxers as Mendoza
and Dutch Sam appeared in the prize ring, although for some time the
“peoplesh” endeavoured to set up the subject of the present sketch in
their place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aby Belasco was born on the 9th of April, 1797, and when he first
exhibited with the gloves, he gave such promising milling specimens that
high hopes were entertained by the Israelites, and their expectations were
increased from his conquests, in succession, over Cribb’s coal-heaver, Josh.
Hudson, and Payne.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>Belasco was in his day a boxer of superior talent, a master of the science,
not wanting for game, not deficient in strength, of an athletic make, a penetrating
eye, and in the ring full of life and activity. His fighting weight
was ten stone and a half, and in height Abraham was five feet six inches and
a half.</p>

<p class='c007'>Belasco’s first battle of note was with a man denominated “Cribb’s coal-eaver,”
in consequence of his being under the patronage of the champion.
This contest was for a subscription purse of five guineas, collected for a
second fight. The activity and science displayed by Belasco on this occasion
attracted the attention of the amateurs, and he was viewed as a pugilist of
rising abilities. In the course of thirty minutes the superiority of Belasco
was so decisive that the coal-heaver was glad to acknowledge he had had
enough. Belasco now obtained the general patronage of the Jews.</p>

<p class='c007'>Near the Barge House at Woolwich, Belasco entered the lists with the
afterwards renowned Josh Hudson. It was a well-fought battle on both
sides, and was contested with great spirit and science for one hour and thirty
minutes, when the smiles of victory again crowned the efforts of the promising
Israelite.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our hero, it seems, was down at Moulsey Hurst on Thursday, April 3,
1817, to witness the fight between Randall and West Country Dick, and, not
to lose sight of the “main chance,” he filled up his time on the ground in
disposing of oranges, thus uniting pleasure with profit, when he was unexpectedly
called upon to enter the ring with “Jack the butcher” (Payne), for
a subscription purse. Belasco, without hesitation, put down his basket of
fruit, peeled himself instead of his oranges, and instantly prepared for action.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was seconded by two of his own people; Jack was attended by
Paddington Jones and Dolly Smith.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Jack, full of bustle, went to
work, planted three hits, and had the best of
the round till they closed, when Belasco got
him against the ropes, fibbed Jack severely,
and both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The latter did not appear to like the
Jew, and held down his head. Belasco went
in with great gaiety, again fibbed the
Butcher, and dropped him.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—This was a spirited round, and Jack
showed fight. Some good blows were exchanged,
till the fibbing system was introduced
by the Jew, when both went down,
Belasco undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—The Butcher’s nob now showed the
handywork of the Jew, the claret was flowing
copiously. In this round Belasco appeared
to do as he liked with his opponent:
he punished him in all directions, and, by
way of concluding, like a good workman,
floored the Butcher, and jumped over him
as he lay on the ground. (Great shouting.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Jack appeared at the scratch, but he
soon ran himself down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—The Jew behaved like a true Christian
in this round. He had it all his own way;
but when he got the Butcher on the ropes,
in a perilous situation, he was too manly to
take advantage of it, lifting up his hands
and walking away amidst thunders of applause.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Belasco nobbed Jack with the utmost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>ease, and ultimately sent him down. It was
rather a sharp round.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—In closing, the Jew fibbed his opponent
terribly, till both fell over the ropes.
(Seven to four on Belasco.)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—It was evident the Butcher wished to
avoid the fist of his adversary: he held down
his head. In struggling, both again out of
the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Jack turned away from his man, but
got peppered for so doing, and was ultimately
sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—The Butcher could not keep his head
out of chancery, and was floored. (Great
applause.)</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Jack seemed quite sick, and curred it
down without a blow. (Disapprobation.)</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Both down, but Belasco took the
lead.</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—After the exchange of a few blows,
Jack was fibbed down, his face covered with
claret.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—If the Butcher possessed anything
like resolution or bottom he might have
stood some chance; but his fighting was all
momentarily, either desperate or currish.
Cool judgment did not work any of his attempts.
He, nevertheless, made some good
hits; but, in closing, was again fibbed till
both went down. (Any odds upon the Jew.)</p>

<p class='c022'>16 and last.—The Butcher ran at the Jew
furiously, but it was too late to turn the
scale, and he received such a floorer that he
would not again appear at the scratch. The
battle continued seventeen minutes and a
half. Belasco retired from the contest without
a scratch, and proved the conqueror in
first-rate style.</p>

<p class='c013'>In consequence of the friends of Davis, the milkman, paying forfeit to
Belasco, he was hastily matched with Reynolds. In this battle he sustained
defeat.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c009'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding this reverse of fortune, Aby’s partisans did not desert
him, and he was considered an able competitor for the accomplished Randall.
He was accordingly matched with the Nonpareil, eight weeks only having
elapsed since his heavy fight with Reynolds. It is true Belasco was defeated,
but it is equally true that he gained much approbation as a skilful boxer;
and the battle between the Jew and Randall, in a scientific point of view,
stands equal to anything on the records of pugilism. See <span class='sc'>Randall</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>,
p. 333.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Belasco was on a sparring tour with Mendoza in Gloucestershire, in
the summer of 1818, he fought the Winchcomb champion, on the race-course
at Cheltenham, a thirteen stone man, for 20 guineas a-side. Abraham won
in the short space of twelve minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the same year, on the 9th of December, Belasco entered the lists at
Coventry with Joe Townsend, who was considered the leading boxer in that
place. Townsend fancied that he could beat Belasco off hand, and put down
his watch and five guineas to back himself. He was a twelve stone man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>Aby at that period only weighed ten stone ten pounds. Belasco proved conqueror
in twenty-four minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Aby’s returning to London he was matched with Phil. Sampson for
50 guineas a-side. The battle took place at Potter’s Street, in Essex, twenty-one
miles from London, on Tuesday, February 22, 1819. This fight was
brought to a wrangle, but the money was ultimately given up to Belasco.
See Life of <span class='sc'>Phil. Sampson</span>, Period VI.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Jew and the Birmingham Youth were continually quarrelling upon
the subject, and a second fight took place between them. See <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid</span></i>. A third
fight, with the gloves, at the Tennis Court (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid</span></i>); and a fourth also occurred
before doubts about each other’s merits could be decided (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid</span></i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Belasco left London for Bristol to fight Cabbage for 100 guineas a-side, in
October, 1820; but, on his arrival in the above city, the friends of Cabbage
would not advance the money. Belasco, however, was well received by the
Bristolians, who, to make up for his disappointment, gave him a most
excellent benefit.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the autumn of 1820 Aby was down at Norwich, with most of the London
pugilists, to witness the second mill between Ned Painter and Tom Oliver
(detailed in this history, in the Life of <span class='sc'>Painter</span>, vol. ii., pp. 85‒88), when, on
the following day, some little misunderstanding occurred between an amateur
of Norwich and Belasco, the latter challenging the swell with offering his
brother, Izzy Belasco, a sum of money to fight a cross with the Bergh Apton
groom; the amateur hereon offered Josh. Hudson £5 if he would give the
Jew a thump on the head for his insolence. This, however, passed over;
but when the sherry was circulating quickly, at Gurney’s Bowling Green,
some chaffing occurred between these old opponents, and Hudson struck
Belasco. This was enough, and which was better man was decided instantly
upon an elegant Turkey carpet. Spring supported the claims of Josh.
Hudson; the Master of the Rolls gave his assistance to the scientific Israelite;
and thirty-five rounds were contested in the most spirited manner, occupying
upwards of forty minutes. Hudson was terribly punished about the head;
but such was his determined courage that, although his shoulder went out
two or three times, and was reduced to its proper situation by Spring, yet
he insisted upon renewing the battle, and continued to fight till Belasco
observed, they were both weak, and that, as he should get nothing, he
(Belasco) would not contend any longer, but that he would fight Hudson for
£100 in London at any time the latter would appoint. Belasco unquestionably
won the fight, as he twice waited upwards of one minute while the
shoulder of Hudson was reduced. The Birmingham Youth gave his bets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>two guineas, as did Spring, one guinea, to Hudson. Belasco received a
dreadful hit on his right eye; but this blow, the Jew asserted, was given
previous to fighting. Hudson was rather inebriated; and next morning, in
company with Scroggins, went to an eminent surgeon, who not only pronounced
that his shoulder had been “out of its place,” but advised Hudson
to take great care of himself, as he would not be enabled to enter the ring
again for at least a twelvemonth. This affair took place on Wednesday,
July 19, 1820.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aby’s next turn was with Phil. Sampson (third battle, December 21,
1820), a glove fight, already noticed in a paragraph above.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pat Halton was about this time brought out as a wonder. According to
report he had beaten all Irish opponents in an unapproachable style. He
was in height five feet eleven inches, and in weight eleven stone. His fame,
which had gone before him, was challenged by Aby Belasco for £50 a-side,
and the event came off at Harpenden Common, near St. Alban’s, on the 8th
of April, 1823.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aby arrived on the ground in a barouche and four, supported by some
swells of his tribe; and at one o’clock his seconds, Richmond and Ben Burn,
threw up his topper. In a few minutes, Pat Halton, arm-in-arm with his
backer, a sporting Irish captain, followed by Randall and Josh. Hudson,
repeated the token of defiance. The odds were guineas to pounds on Belasco.
Tho colours, yellow for the Jew, and green (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i> Randall) for Halton, were
tied to the stakes.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—On stripping, the lathy appearance
of Paddy astonished his backers beyond
description: his ribs were bare, his legs and
arms were thin, his countenance pale, his
lips white, and, in fact, he was as light as a
cork. Belasco, on the contrary, was never
in more prime trim. Some little squaring
at each other occurred, when the Jew gave
his opponent a tap on the cheek; Paddy returned
without effect. Halton again missed.
A long pause. Belasco planted another
facer without any return. Halton’s right
hand missed the Jew. At length some exchanges
took place, and Belasco hit Halton
as he was going down.</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The Irishman showed first blood; he
had napped a clumsy thump on his left ear.
After a few exchanges, in a close, the Jew
fibbed his opponent; but Halton got the
throw, and Belasco was undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—The Jews were in raptures, and the
judges of milling had made up their minds
as to the result. Belasco hit his opponent
on the body without any return; a facer
ditto. This conduct made Halton angry,
and he missed the Jew. Belasco gave
another bodier without return; also a nobber
Halton missed; in fact, he did not come
near enough to hit his opponent. Belasco
again fibbed his opponent at the ropes, but
Halton got the throw. (Six to four on the
Jew.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4 and 5.—Belasco bodied his opponent
several times, and got away with the greatest
ease. In the latter round Belasco caught
hold of his adversary by the hip. Randall
said, “Foul! and if Belasco did so again he
would take Halton out of the ring.”</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—It was evident the Irishman had no
chance; he went down from a hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Belasco received a severe lunging hit
on the side of his head. The leariness of
the Jew was peculiarly striking in this
round. Belasco gave Halton a body blow,
and got away cleverly; repeated this liberty,
tried it on a third time with equal success,
when Aby burst out into a loud laugh.
Halton endeavoured to return, but his hits
were all out of distance.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Halton missed numerous hits. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>short rally took place, and the Irishman’s
head was sent out of the ropes; but he got
it in the ring again, when his left eye was
nearly hit up. A pause. Halton missed his
adversary, when the Jew gave him a clean
knock-down blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—This was a sharp round, and Belasco
received two or three hits on his body and
arms. Some exchanges took place, and as
the Jew was endeavouring to get away he
received a hit on the chest that floored him,
but he jumped on his knees instantly. (A
rare shout for Halton.)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—The Irishman’s face was clareted,
and he had napped pepper: he never had a
chance of winning. Some exchanges took
place, but to the disadvantage of Halton,
although the Jew went down. (Murmurs
from Halton’s party; and exclamations,
“The Jew went down without a hit!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>11 and last.—On appearing at the scratch,
Halton’s nob was materially altered, from
the punishment in the last round; and
Belasco made an attempt at finishing his
work. Some sharp blows passed, and the
Irishman went down. Belasco, in falling,
touched the face of his opponent with one of
his knees. Randall called out “Foul!” and
said he would take his man out of the ring.
Halton said to the umpires, “It is foul!”
The latter replied they saw nothing unfair,
and desired the fight to proceed. Randall,
however, took his man out of the ring,
regardless of their decision; and when time
was called, Belasco appeared at the scratch.
Hudson, who had not left his post, and in
the bustle had lost sight of Randall and
Halton, was looking after them; but the
Jew, having no opponent to meet him, was
declared by the umpires to be the winner.
Considerable confusion ensued, and a comical
scene tied up the matter, producing
roars of laughter from the spectators in the
wagons. Tho roped ring was instantly filled
with persons of every description, all eager
to learn the event. A Babel row commenced,
followed by a general fight, and
many blows were given and received. It
was the general opinion that Halton could
not have fought two more rounds. However
all the bets, or nearly so, were paid,
and the stakes given up to Belasco upon the
stakeholder receiving the undersigned document.</p>

<p class='c032'>Belasco left the ring almost without a

minutes when the interruption took place.</p>

<p class='c013'>Belasco a fourth time met Sampson, at Crawley Hurst, August 19, 1823,
and was once again beaten. See <span class='sc'>Sampson</span>, Period VI.</p>

<p class='c007'>Resolved not to close his fistic career in defeat, Belasco, though he had
formally retired and become an L. V. in Whitechapel, presented himself,
after Dick Curtis and Ayres had finished their battle at Shepperton Grange,
May 25, 1824, with the enquiry whether George Weston, who had promised
Aby a thrashing, intended to carry out his threat? The insult to Belasco, it
appears, had occurred during the fight between Ned Neale and Tom Gaynor.
Weston declared his readiness, and £16 were immediately put into a purse
by the amateurs. The battle was a burlesque: Aby so punished Weston all
over the ring, that he surrendered after three rounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this period Aby figured merely as a second and a sparrer. His later
career was disreputable, as a keeper of low gambling houses, night houses,
supper rooms, and such like resorts of midnight and morning debauchery,
which brought him into repeated conflicts with the law. His life no further
concerns the history of the ring.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>CY. DAVIS, “THE GAY BRISTOL BOY”—1818‒1823.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Cyrus Davis was one of those boxers who shine with a reflected light,
borrowed from the renown of the man they have conquered; his defeat of
the game and scientific Ned Turner establishing his claim to notice, and also
his extensive acquaintance as a tradesman, in after life, first in the vicinity of
old Smithfield Market, where for many years he was landlord of the Bear
and Ragged Staff, of the Plough, in Giltspur Street, and subsequently an
L. V. at the New Cattle Market, Islington.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cyrus was born in the Broadway, Bristol, November 27, 1795, and was,
at fourteen years of age, apprenticed to a butcher. His height was five feet
nine inches, his weight a trifle under eleven stone, far exceeded in his later
days. His appearance was prepossessing, and his first lessons in the art were
received from his townsman, George Nicholls, celebrated as the only conqueror
of Cribb. Pierce Egan gives the usual early undated victories to
Davis, which we pass to come to his first recorded London display.</p>

<p class='c007'>Davis was introduced to the cognoscenti of the metropolis by Tom Belcher,
and attracted much notice by his activity in sparring and decisive precision
of hitting. Cy. was taken down to Rickmansworth by his patron, on Friday,
June 10, 1818, to witness the battle between Neat and Oliver (see <span class='sc'>Neat</span>,
Vol. II., Period V., Chapter IV.) That event decided, there was a purse of
twenty guineas to be disposed of, five guineas for the loser. Abraham
Belasco offered himself, when young Cyrus, stepping into the ring, offered
to accommodate the circumcised champion. The members of the P. C. were
delighted. Tom Belcher and Tom Cribb volunteered themselves as seconds
to the young Bristolian, and the Israelite was picked up by Tom Jones and
Cropley. Two to one on Davis.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The style of fighting exhibited
by Cy. was something after the manner of
Tom Belcher when that pugilist first entered
the London ring. Davis went to work
rapidly, with one, two. It was a sharp
round altogether; but Davis took the lead
and sent Belasco down. (Great applause.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—One of Davis’s eyes was a little touched,
but he again went sharply to work. The
Jew, in closing, endeavoured to fib his opponent,
and also threw him.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—This was a short round. Davis went
down from a slight hit, or rather a slip; he
instantly jumped up laughing, ready to renew
the attack, but Belasco sat down on his
second’s knee.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—The liveliness of Davis was the admiration
of the ring. He had it all his own way
this round, and, with a tremendous right-handed
hit, he floored Belasco. (Tumultuous
applause.) 5 to 2 on Davis.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Cy. endeavoured to repeat the dose,
but without the desired effect. The Jew
received some sharp facers, but in return got
Davis down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—In this round the fine science displayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>by Belasco was much praised. He stopped
six blows in succession of his opponent:
nevertheless Belasco was sent down.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Some sharp work, till Belasco, in
closing, fibbed Davis severely till he went
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The milling talents of Davis in this
round were conspicuous: he dealt out much
severe punishment to Belasco with his right
hand, and with great quickness gave the Jew
a back-hander, when he went down like a
shot. (Tumultuous applause, and “It’s all
your own, Davis.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Belasco looked rather queerish on
arriving at the scratch, when Davis finished
him with a right-handed flooring hit. It
was all over in ten minutes. Belasco would
not fight any more.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Davis throughout the above
battle was as gay as a dancing-master. His
appearance and mode of hitting prepossessed
the amateurs in his favour. The quickness
of Davis was truly astonishing, undressing
himself, getting into the ring, and winning
the battle only occupied our hero fifteen
minutes. Belasco, it was urged by his own
“peoplesh,” was not in condition; and therefore
the £5 had some charms for him as a
losing man. However, he could not have
won that day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Davis, soon after this battle, returned to follow his business at Bristol,
but he had made so strong an impression on the amateurs that Cy. was soon
brought to town and matched against Ned Turner for 100 guineas a-side.
They fought at Wallingham Common, Surrey, on Friday, June 18, 1819.
How he was defeated may be seen at p. 385, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moulsey Hurst, the delight of the fancy for its velvet turf, was, on
Tuesday, August 24, 1819, again selected for a British and Irish pugilistic
display of manhood. Boshell, recently imported from Paddy’s Land, was
known on the Curragh from a spirited turn-up there, but an entire stranger
to the London prize ring, except from the good character given of him by
Randall. In a trial set-to with the latter it was thought by some of his
countrymen that he might establish himself among the light weights; therefore
he was backed for 50 guineas a-side. Davis’s recent defeat with Turner
had placed him rather in the back-ground; but the good judges viewed it as
an easy thing for the “Bristol Boy,” and two to one on Davis was offered on
the preceding evening at the sporting houses. The old ring goers and a
sprinkling of the Corinthians were present. On the Commander-in-chief<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c009'><sup>[169]</sup></a>
and his party crossing the water, the combatants were ordered to prepare for
action; and Boshell, with much confidence, threw his hat into the ring,
attended by Tom Jones and Larkins. Davis, waited upon by Harmer and
Shelton as his seconds, answered the challenge. The hands were crossed in
friendship, and the men set-to.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Boshell looked compact and
well, but the remains of a small blister
appeared on his lower ribs. Davis was as
fine as could be wished, and smiled as if
confident of success. The attitude and
manner of Boshell soon convinced the amateurs
that science was not his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i>. Davis
tapped him on the arm and got away; ditto
and ditto; some little sparring; when Davis
let fly, and a sharp facer was the result.
Two or three awkward exchanges occurred,
and Boshell planted a heavy body hit. They
fought into a close, and, after some little
struggling, Davis was thrown, and undermost.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>(Seven to four, and two to one was
loudly offered on Davis.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The Bristol Boy soon put in a facer,
that not only drew the pink, but seemed like
an electric shock on the upper works of poor
Paddy. Some awkward blows again passed.
The Irishman got the throw. (Three to one
upon Davis.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Davis, with his left hand, put one of
Paddy’s eyes into mourning. Boshell, however,
made some good stops, but he had not
a single point towards finishing a round well.
Davis was again undermost. (All betters;
and “It will soon be over,” was the cry.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Boshell showed himself as game a bit
of stuff as ever peeled in this round. The
hitting was sharp on both sides, but Davis
got away, and Boshell, in following him, received
one of the Bristol Boy’s lunging hits
on the nose, when he instantly fell on his
face, the claret flowing rapidly. (“It’s all
up now; he can’t fight two more rounds.”
Oliver offered five to one on the last event,
and twenty to one he lost the battle.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Boshell came up distressed, but game
as a Purcell, and endeavoured to lash out.
He was, however, milled all over the ring,
and fell at the ropes, rolling over on his face
exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—The mug of Paddy was a picture of
punishment; both his eyes damaged and his
face altogether changed. Fresh milling was
added, but he nevertheless threw Davis.</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—This was a sharp round. Boshell went
down exhausted. (“It’s poundable—take
him away.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—The claret was now trickling down the
nose of Davis. After some heavy exchanges
they broke from a close, and Boshell fought
till he fell on his knees, and caught hold of
the ropes distressed.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—Davis winked to his friends that it was
all right, and planted three facers in succession.
Boshell, however, showed the fight
was not taken out of him, and again threw
his opponent a heavy fall. (“Bravo, Boshell,
you are a game fellow!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—The face of the Irishman was piteous.
Boshell went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—In struggling for the throw, Davis
slipped on his knees. This was thought unhandsome;
but Boshell held up his hands,
not to hit him foul. (“Bravo!” from all
parts of the ring.)</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Boshell endeavoured to make some
hits, but went down exhausted.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Boshell was floored like a shot, from
a tremendous lunging blow on his nob.
(Any odds.)</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Boshell, groggy, was hit down, but in
falling he caught the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Boshell came up staggering, and soon
went down. Time was called, and it was
thought he had given up. Davis’s hat was
thrown into the air, and the outer ring
broken.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Boshell said he was not done, and
another round took place, but he was hit
down. Paddy was, however, so game, he
declared he would not say “No.” He had
no chance, and was taken away. Davis,
elated with his success, jumped over the
ropes out of the ring, without a scratch. It
was over in fifteen minutes and ten seconds.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—If any remarks can be made,
a few words will suffice. Boshell is a game,
a very game man, and his courage was the
admiration of the ring; but as a fighter has
no pretensions. Indeed he was little more
than a plaything in the scientific hands of
Davis.</p>

<p class='c013'>At Spring’s benefit at the Fives Court, on Tuesday, November 2, 1819,
our hero made a considerable impression upon the minds of the amateurs, by
the display of science in a set-to with the Nonpareil. Upon the appearance
of Randall, followed by Cy. Davis, the audience seemed extremely anxious
for the set-to. The confidence of the “Bristol Boy” astonished all; he
exhibited considerable improvement. In fact, with the gloves, the Nonpareil
never met such a successful opponent before. Davis did not get off
without a good receipt of Randall’s talents; nevertheless, the former put in
two or three dexterous facers and made some fine stops. The fanciers were
all alive; the Court rang with applause. It was generally admitted that the
advantage was on the side of Davis. Upon pulling off the gloves another
round was called for and complied with. Both the combatants were now
upon the alert, and it was a fine specimen of skill and courage. A well-contested
long rally occurred, and Davis again acquitted himself in such good
style as to raise his character in the sporting world.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>Davis felt so much mortified at his defeat by Turner that he was often
heard to say that he should never feel satisfied until he had the chance at
least of a second trial with his brave opponent. This feeling accounts in
some measure for his not showing in the prize ring, or figuring in the “gag”
correspondence and boxing challenges then so much in vogue in the “sporting”
press. However, somebody made some letters for him about fights
with Gipsy Cooper, Phil. Sampson, and Turner, which Pierce Egan prints
with the curious foot-note, “This letter was a <em>hoax</em>!” (“Boxiana,” vol iv.,
p. 166.)</p>

<p class='c007'>On the second match being made, at the Castle Tavern, Holborn, between
Turner and Cy. Davis for £100 a-side, the following remarks appeared in
the <cite>Weekly Dispatch</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Davis is decidedly the favourite five to four, and in a few instances, for
small sums, six to four is betted. It is nearly four years since, June 18,
1819, at Wallingham Common, that Davis was defeated by Turner in thirty-two
rounds, forty-five minutes. Turner also defeated Martin in forty rounds,
one hour and seven minutes, October 26, 1819; but since that period Ned
has in turn surrendered to Martin. Davis won with Boshell, August 24,
1819, in sixteen rounds, fifteen minutes and ten seconds. This might be
termed no match. The most important point taken into consideration by
the sporting men in this battle is the modes of life pursued by the combatants
for the last three years. Davis has lived regularly, and added to the
good effects of training; he is as fresh as a ‘four year old,’ ‘fine as a star,’
and as confident of victory as if the battle was over. Would we could say
so much for ‘poor Ould Ned;’ indeed, a few months since an opinion was
entertained by the supporters of pugilism that Turner was more likely to
make his exit than to show again in the prize ring. However, Ned laughs
at these remarks, and asserts he is quite well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fight took place at Harpenden Common, twenty-five miles from
London, and four from St. Alban’s, on Tuesday, February 18, 1823.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the Monday night previous to the battle, the Castle Tavern, although
overflowing with company, was a blank as to betting. This sort of silence
on a night previous to a mill occasioned one of the most respectable ring
goers, and a sound sporting man for the previous twenty-five years, to
observe sarcastically—“It was a square fight between Turner and Davis,
which accounted for chaffing instead of betting. Ready made luck,” said he,
“is wanting, and therefore a certain Bet of people will not chance a crown
without the office ‘to a certainty’ is to be had in private. Nevertheless, I
am glad of it,” concluded the wag, “it will bring the prize ring back to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>good old times (although ‘honesty is a ragged virtue’), when such men as the
late Colonel Mellish and Fletcher Reid brought their men into the ring,
exclaiming, without fear of anything being attempted on the part of the
boxers to do wrong, ‘I’ll bet 600 to 400.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The weather on Tuesday morning was rather inauspicious to a long
journey, yet it did not prevent the thorough-bred ones from starting for the
scene of action. At one o’clock Cy. Davis threw up his castor, followed by
Richmond and Harmer as his seconds. Turner, close at his heels, arm-in-arm
with the President of the Daffy Club, followed his example, attended by
Tom Cribb and Josh. Hudson. Five to four on Davis. Cy., smiling, went
up and shook hands with Ned. The colours, blue for Turner and yellow for
Davis were tied to the stakes by Cribb and Richmond.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The condition of Cy. was beautiful
in the extreme; he was a perfect picture
of a man in fine health. Turner, although
not up to the above mark, was, nevertheless,
well patched up as to the look of the thing.
The skin of Davis was transparent, ruddy,
and healthful, while Turner’s exhibited a
yellowish hue. Both extremely cautious;
and the great difficulty of getting at the Old
One prevented Cy. from making play. Turner,
at length, let fly, and put in a slight hit
on the body with his left hand. More
dodging. Turner stopped the right of his
opponent well; both extremely active on
their legs. Turner put in another bodier;
some exchanges, but of no consequence. Cy.
tried to put in his favourite blow with his
right hand, but was again stopped. Cy.,
somewhat tired, put down his hands for an
instant, but Ned took no notice of it. Exchange
of blows at the ropes: a struggle for
the throw; both down, but Cy. undermost.
This round occupied six minutes; and the
friends of Turner shouted, and said, “it was
all right, the Old One behaves well.”</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—Turner missed a well-meant left-handed
blow at the body. Neither of them
eager to go to work, both anticipating
danger. The right hand of Cy. told, after
a few exchanges, and Turner went down.
(A shout for Davis from the Bristolians.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Although in such fine condition, Davis
was piping a little, and Turner kept hitting
at the body. Some exchanges took place,
but the blows were light on both sides.
Owing to the slippery state of the ground,
Turner went down from a slight hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—It had been expected that three rounds
would not have passed over without some
mischief, nevertheless this was a good round.
Cy. smiled with confidence, and made himself
up to do severe execution with his right,
but Turner, with considerable skill, stopped
him. Nothing done yet, and in a struggle
both went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Whether it was from partiality to the
Old One or not, the friends of Turner urged
he had none the worst of it; in fact, no severity
of punishment had passed on either
side. In closing, Turner had the best of the
fibbing, and Cy. showed first blood. Davis
got the throw cleverly, and Turner was
undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—The left hand of Davis seemed of no
use to him, except, after the manner of the
late Gas-light-Man, to hold his opponent.
Some good fighting occurred in this round,
and the finish of it was to the advantage of
Cy., who fell heavily on Turner. (Seven to
four.)</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Turner placed many of his blows well;
but the strength of his hitting, which on
former occasions appeared prominent, seemed
to have left him. The great <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> of Davis
was to put in his right hand; and had not
Turner stopped it often, the fight would soon
have been at an end. Turner again had the
best of the fibbing, and Cy. was undermost.
(Several of the partizans of Turner began
now to flatter themselves that victory was
within his reach. Loud shouting, “Turner
for ever!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—If Davis had commenced play, and
fought with both hands, another tale must
have been told. However, in this round,
some severe execution was done. Turner’s
left hand drew the claret from Cy.’s nose and
mouth, and he appeared for the instant a
little abroad; he also received a heavy body
blow, but recovered and sent down Turner
with a right-handed hit on the head. (“It’s
all over,” from the cutting tribe of Newgate-market.
“You have won it, Davis.” Two
to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—The friends of Turner began to quake
a little, recollecting the almost finishing blow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>Ned received in his last round. This hit
took a little of the fight out of Turner, and
he came up bleeding and weak to the scratch,
but his game did wonders for him. Davis
now went to work a little. Turner, game as
a pebble, returned hit for hit, till he fell
exhausted. While on his second’s knee,
Randall, Holt, Curtis, &amp;c., gave the Old One
advice gratis, how he should act, so anxious
did they feel for his success.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—Ned came to the scratch like a high-couraged
man, determined to strain every
nerve for victory, although the chance was
against him. He, however, had no idea of
losing at this stage of the battle. Yet the
patch-work began to peep, and the effects of
premature age could not be hid. Turner
received a bodier that sent him down. (The
backers of Davis now booked it as safe, and
inspired their hero with shouts of approbation.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—Davis commenced fighting, and
planted a severe hit with his right hand
on the body of his opponent. Turner, however,
stood up and exchanged hit for hit, till
a pause was necessary on both sides. Cy.
was weak in turn, and kept sparring for
wind, yet smiling at his opponent. Turner’s
left ear was bleeding from a severe hit, and
in following Cyrus he slipped, or went down
from a slight hit. The truth could no longer
be hid; Turner was going every round; he
fought like a man; but the stamina was
wanting.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—On the part of Turner this was an
excellent fighting round. In spite of his
distress, his stops were so excellent as to
claim applause from all parts of the ring.
Cy. also exhibited fine science. Hit for hit,
but the hardest blows were in favour of
Davis, and Ned kept up the game till he fell,
overcome with fatigue.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Turner was equal to his adversary in
milling; but there was no comparison between
the effect of their blows. They followed
each other over the ring, exchanging
hits in the most manly style, till an accession
of wind was necessary on both sides. At the
ropes a struggle took place, and in going
down, Turner uppermost. (“Well done both,”
from all parties.)</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Cy. made a blow with his right hand
at the body, but it fell rather low. “Come,”
says Josh., “fight fair; recollect you are to
hit above the waistband.” A good round,
but Turner down exhausted. (Ten to two.
Several of the fighting men came to the
ropes, and in their anxiety for his winning,
gave Ned hints what to do.)</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—Cy. had decidedly the best of the
hitting in this round; he also threw Turner
and fell on him heavily. This fall shook
poor Ned, and he was placed on the knee of
his second with difficulty. In fact, it won
the battle. (Any odds.)</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—Tom Belcher observed to Davis—“Why
not use both of your hands?” Here
Hudson said that Belcher had no business to
interfere, it was unfair. “It was not my
intention to have said a single word,” replied
Tom, “if I had not seen so many fighting
men breaking in the ring, and, like Trueman’s
cocks, all on one side. I have not one
farthing on the battle; all I want is fair
play.” Cy. took Belcher’s hint, but Turner
opposed him gamely till down.</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—The Old One, good to the last, exchanged
blow for blow till he was hit down.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—On coming to the scratch, Cy. immediately
went to work with his right hand,
met Turner in the body, and sent him down
in a twinkling. The President of the Daffies
(under whose direction Turner was brought
into the ring) humanely stepped forward,
and said, “he should not fight any more.”
He (the President) would not stand by and
see one of the bravest men of the ring
wantonly cut up, when he had no chance.
It was over in thirty-five minutes. Davis
shook hands with Turner, gave a jump,
huzzaed for joy, and left the ring.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—However ill-natured it may
appear, the truth is that Turner has no one
to blame but himself,—he was in no condition
to fight. A boxer, like a general, if he
wishes to prove successful, ought always to
be prepared for his enemy. Turner admits,
with great candour, that he could not have
fought another round. He was not defeated
by the blows he received, but he attributes
his defeat to fatigue and exhaustion, Nature
having refused to second his mind. It was
but the shadow of that Ned Turner who defeated
the terror of the ring, Scroggins, twice;
who fought with Randall for two hours and
twenty-two minutes; and obtained a victory
over the Master of the Rolls. It was,
nevertheless, a brave, good fight on both
sides; and it is but doing common justice to
Davis, to state that his conduct was manly
and interesting to the spectator. Cy. also
fought under great disadvantage and pain.
After the seventh round, his right hand went,
and was much swelled. Davis possesses in his
person the finest requisites for a fighting
man. Mr. Jackson not being present, we
are sorry to say not a shilling was subscribed
for Turner. Davis was not hurt.</p>

<p class='c013'>The above victory proved rather a dear triumph to Davis: he was disabled
from appearing again in the prize ring. The fore-finger of his right hand met
with so serious an injury, from the knuckle coming in contact with Turner’s
teeth, that, after baffling the most skilful surgeons for a considerable time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>Davis was ultimately compelled to submit to an operation which deprived
him of his index finger. With this battle his fistic career closed. Not so his
public life. Cy. was for many years a publican, but no more of a sinner than
his neighbours. He died on the 8th of March, 1846, aged 51, at the house
of his son, the White Bear, Kennington Common (now Kennington Park), of
disease of the heart, and lies buried in the churchyard of St. Mark in that
parish.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PEACE INGLIS, “THE PHENOMENON”—1822‒1824.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Peace Inglis, known among his companions as “the Mattress Maker,”
was a smart young fellow of five feet eight inches, weighing ten stone four
pounds. His first appearance in the ring was with Hamilton, the waterman,
for 20 guineas, at Moulsey, on the 22nd of October, 1822. On this occasion,
Josh. Hudson, who had taken Hamilton, a “below-bridge man,” under his
wing, seconded his <em>protegé</em>, Paddington Jones looking after Inglis. It was a
brave battle on both sides for forty-two minutes, when Inglis was hailed as
conqueror.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young aspirant’s first essay had so much surpassed the expectations of
his backers that he was matched against Bill Davis (Deaf Davis), a well-known
good man, and the battle came off at Harpenden Common, near
St. Alban’s, February 18, 1823, in the same ring in which Cy. Davis (see
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>) had defeated Ned Turner. On this occasion, Josh., dissatisfied with
the defeat of Hamilton, seconded Davis, having with him Jack Scroggins and
the east end division. Inglis was attended on by Jem Ward (then rising
into fame, having beaten Ned Baldwin a fortnight previous) and a friend
named Rogers. The watch was held by an amateur.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—The Deaf ’un had scarcely put
himself into attitude, when in he went like
a hammer-man at an anvil, gave his opponent
a smash in the middle of the head, and
floored him like a shot. (Six to four on
Davis. “Where’s your clever fighter?”)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The “feather-bed” hero proved himself
to have no soft place about him. He
stood up manfully, but received three facers
in succession, was nobbed over the ring, and
fell covered with claret. (Two to one on
Davis.)</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Inglis came gamely up, when Davis
once more punished him, and he turned his
back on his opponent, set off running, and
was only stopped by the ropes. Here Davis
caught his adversary, and once more levelled
him. (A guinea to a shilling was offered,
but no takers; and “Take him away,” from
all parts of the ring; “he will be killed.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Contrary to all expectation, the feather-bed
maker was not so “soft” as he appeared
to be; he met Davis like a trump, hit out
straight with both hands, and, after a desperate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>rally, Davis was hit down almost
senseless.</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—Inglis had now got the turn. He put
a new face on Davis, milled him from one
side of the ring to the other, and levelled
the deaf one with his native dust.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—Davis, relying on strength, was determined
not to be “told out.” He again took
the lead, and nobbed the feather-bed hero,
when Inglis, by a flush hit, sent him down.
It was not quite a finisher, but it found out
the condition of Davis. (Inglis was now the
favourite.)</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—This round was “portrait-painting”
with a vengeance. A rally took place, in
which Davis received a severe cut over the
left eye, and was floored again. (Any odds.
“Feathers for a trifle.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>8 and last.—Such fighting as was seen in
the above seven rounds, and hitting in the
right places, must always produce short
fights. Davis exerted himself in returning
hit for hit, till another floorer put an end to
the battle. On time being called, Davis
observed to his second, “that he could
not stand.” It was all over in twelve
minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—Such a cutting-up had not
been witnessed for a long time. In the
exultation of the moment the friends of
Inglis challenged Dick Curtis. Inglis was
about ten stone. Dick replied he would not
refuse the challenge. Davis was carried out
of the ring. He was too stale for a young
opponent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Inglis, from his brave conduct in the fight with Davis, was next matched
against George Curtis, the brother of the Pet, for £50 a-side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moulsey Hurst, on Tuesday, August 12, 1823, was again the scene of
attraction. The umpires and referee were chosen, and, at one o’clock,
George Curtis threw his hat into the ring, attended by Josh. Hudson and
Harry Holt. Inglis, followed by Paddington Jones and Neale, also threw
up his beaver. He was the favourite at five to four.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Curtis exhibited much activity
on his pins, and, on peeling, displayed a
more muscular frame than had been anticipated.
His face was pale, his nob looked
like a milling one, and altogether had a
great resemblance to that of the Pet. Inglis
was as well as he could be—a wiry strong
young man, the taller of the two, and appeared
to stand over his opponent. The
attitudes of the men on setting-to were interesting.
Inglis was in no hurry to proceed
to blows; and Curtis, as a novice, deliberated
before he went to work. George made an
attempt with his left hand, but it told slightly.
This movement led to an exchange of hits,
yet nothing was the matter. A long pause.
Curtis retreated from some heavy blows;
Inglis, however, planted a severe nobber.
“I’ll bet £100 to a tizzy,” said Paddington
Jones, “it’s as right as the day; we shall
win the fight.” “Walker! hookey!” replied
Josh. The left hand of George told
smartly on Inglis’s body; and, after some
cut-and-come-again work at the ropes, in
struggling for the throw, both went down,
Curtis undermost. (Six and seven to four on
Inglis.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The left eve of Curtis was winking.
Inglis, on the alert, planted a hit; an exchange
of blows. Curtis again felt for his
adversary’s body. Inglis missed a well-meant
blow for his opponent’s nob; he, however,
tried it again, but George stopped him
with great skill. (“Bravo, Georgy!” from
his pals.) A pause. After some little time,
both combatants made themselves up to do
mischief, and, on getting within each other’s
reach, they let fly, which produced the claret.
(“First blood,” exclaimed Josh. and Jones at
the same instant. “Upon my honour, it
appeared first on your side,” said Josh.,
“and I hope you will not dispute the honour
of the John Bull fighter, my Tommy!” It
was rather a doubtful point at the moment.)
Curtis went down weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Inglis, to the astonishment of the spectators,
did not fight first, and a long pause
ensued. Curtis commenced milling on the
retreat, and the feather-bed hero napped
three nasty ones on his index. Another
stand-still for a minute, looking at each
other. Inglis stopped well, when the combatants
got into a sharp rally at the ropes.
In struggling for the throw, Inglis got his
opponent upon the ropes; and, in this situation,
Curtis received pepper until he went
down exhausted. (“It’s all over. I’ll bet
ten to one that Curtis can’t fight two more
rounds,” was repeated by the betting men
round the ring.)</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—The left eye of George was nearly
closed; but when time was called he showed
himself at the scratch. Although the advantage
was now decidedly in Inglis’s favour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>he did not commence fighting; and Curtis,
recovering his wind, made play with his left
hand, and had none the worst of it. This
was altogether a milling round. Curtis
threw his opponent. (Thunders of applause
from the Bermondsey boys.)</p>

<p class='c022'>5.—It was no secret to the spectators that
Curtis at this period of the battle was the
weaker man; but his coolness was the admiration
of all present. Some good hitting
and stopping were displayed on both sides.
Curtis planted a rum one on the feather-bed’s
throat that made him gasp for breath.
Inglis also received three or four nobbers
that stopped his exertions; but at the ropes
he had the best of it, and punished Curtis
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>6.—This round was a fine display of manhood;
punishment on both sides all over the
ring. Inglis got Curtis on the ropes, and was
pelting him with divers blows in sundry
places, when, by an extraordinary effort,
Curtis broke away, put in a facer, and drove
his opponent to the opposite side of the ring,
where he held Inglis for a short time at the
ropes, and then sent him down. (The applause
for Curtis was loud.)</p>

<p class='c022'>7.—Short, but full of mischief. Curtis
received a heavy fall on his back, which
shook him sadly and added to his exhausted
state.</p>

<p class='c022'>8.—Another short round, but rather dangerous
to Inglis. In struggling for the
throw, Curtis went down. “Foul! foul!”
The ring was broken: it was asserted Inglis
had caught hold of his opponent’s thigh in a
way not allowed by the laws of boxing.</p>

<p class='c022'>9.—The right hand of Curtis was open;
he, nevertheless, had decidedly the best of
the hitting in this round till Inglis bored
him down out of the ropes.</p>

<p class='c022'>10.—The game which had been so conspicuously
displayed by George induced
many of his backers to stick to him. Inglis,
with all his strength, did not take the lead
of Curtis as was expected. In fact, George,
in most instances, had the best of the milling;
but, in finishing the round, Inglis
generally had the advantage. (Two to one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—This round was truly an out-and-out
one on both sides. Curtis vindicated the
pedigree of his race for “bottom, bone,
blood.” It would be detracting from Inglis
to withhold from him that he showed himself
as high-couraged and game as his brave
adversary. It was hit for hit all over the
ring—backwards and forwards, in and out of
the corners, and round about, till the combatants
were at a stand-still. To it again
like true Britons, till nature could no longer
assist their minds. At the ropes they were
both so exhausted as to take hold of each
other and push each other down, Inglis
uppermost. (Applause. “Here’s a round
for you!” “Why, they are both East-nders,”
said Josh., “and that accounts for
it. We can get nothing among the coves of
the West, so we are obliged to fight amongst
our own breed.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Curtis threw his opponent.</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Inglis received several blows on his
nob, and at times was much distressed. If
he had not been a very game man he would
have cut it. Curtis endeavoured to keep the
lead, and fought till he fell exhausted.
“Take him away, Josh.; he can’t win it,”
said a patron of the P. R.; “it is a pity to
witness so game a man cut to pieces.”
Curtis, while sitting on the knee of his
second, overheard the above remark, and he
answered, “I will not be taken away; I am
sure I shall not lose it; I <em>will</em> not lose it.”</p>

<p class='c022'>14.—Curtis was so determined that to say
“No” never entered his mind. After an
exchange of blows Curtis received a severe
fall. “Take him away,” from all parts of
the ring. (Any odds upon Inglis.) George
said he would not give it in.</p>

<p class='c022'>15 and last.—Curtis planted a blow on his
opponent’s throat; but it was too feeble to
do much mischief. In a short rally Curtis
was hit down, when “the Pet”<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c009'><sup>[170]</sup></a> threw up
his hat, and declared George should not
fight any more. It was over in fifty-five
minutes. Inglis went up to Curtis, and
shook hands with him.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—If Curtis had been as fresh as
his opponent a different tale might have
been told. He fought like a brave man;
and, although he could not achieve victory,
he obtained a high character in the pugilistic
circles. George was overmatched;
indeed, any boxer who wishes to have a turn
with Inglis, will find plenty of work cut out
for him before the battle is at an end.
Curtis was taken out of the ring by his
brother, and exhibited severe marks of
punishment. The nob of Inglis did not show
much beating; but he received many hard
blows during the fight. Four pounds were
collected on the ground for Curtis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Peace Inglis now stood so high in the estimation of his friends, that he
challenged Harry Holt for £100 a-side; but a match being made on the spur
of the moment with the brave Ned Turner, for £100 a-side, the fight with
Holt went off. After a considerable time allowed for the training of Turner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>the above match was decided at Colnbrook, seventeen miles and a half from
London, on Tuesday, April 26, 1824.</p>

<p class='c007'>The road was lively, but not thronged with company as heretofore; in
fact, it was more select than usual. When “Time” was called, Turner
walked coolly into the ring, followed by Josh. Hudson and Paddington Jones.
He was well received by the crowd, like an old performer returning to play
a favourite part. Some little delay occurred, when the John Bull boxer
roared out, “Come, you Inglis! Where are you? Don’t you like it? We
are ready.” Inglis appeared immediately, waited upon by Maurice Delay
and Dan M’Kenzie, and threw his hat into the ring. The colours, light blue
for Inglis and dark blue for Turner, were tied to the stakes. Everything
being adjusted according to custom, the men stood up for</p>

    <div>THE FIGHT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Round 1.—Turner looked better than was
expected; his face was tanned with the sun,
and his legs appeared firm and round. His
eye was bright, his countenance serene and
placid, and the invigorating breezes of the
Welsh mountains, where he had been training,
had imparted vigour to his limbs. The
heart, too, that just and indispensable attribute
of a boxer, was sound, and Ned declared
himself confident of victory. His opponent
must not be passed slightly over. He is one
of the bravest of the brave men belonging to
the prize ring. The contrast between the
combatants was striking. The youthful
Inglis was a model; fine as a star, strong as
a lion, game as a pebble, and confident as a
Randall. The odds were decidedly in favour
of Inglis, £20 to £30. Turner and Inglis
are in attitude, and on the look out for the
first blow. The superiority as to knowledge
of fighting was conspicuous on the part of
Ned, who let fly his left teazer, which told
heavily on Inglis’s bread-basket. One or
two stops occurred, when the left hand of
Ned operated so sharply on the throat of the
young one that he went down like a shot.
(An artillery report of applause for Turner.)</p>

<p class='c022'>2.—The mark of Turner’s fist on the throat
of his opponent was visible to every spectator.
Inglis tried to do something, but the
Old One was too clever to be caught napping.
Turner made both his right and left
hand tell on Inglis’s nob. An exchange of
blows to the advantage of Ned. The young one
had two more “nasty hits” on the mouth,
as Josh. termed them, at the same time
exclaiming, “First blood! My eye, what a
hobble you have got into, my covey.” Turner
again planted two left-handed blows,
and immediately afterwards put in a severe
one, two. Inglis was now bleeding from his
mouth. Turner made another hit. “Talk
of Old Ones,” said Josh.; “is there anything
like the good Old Ones?” An exchange
of blows, but Inglis did no execution.
The latter received another terrible hit on
his mouth. Inglis did not know what to do
with his adversary. A pause. “I’ll bet fifty
to twenty,” said Randall. Turner’s left hand
repeated the dose. In closing, Turner had
decidedly the best of it. Inglis’s face bleeding
in all parts of it. Both down, but the
Old One undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>3.—Short. Turner’s left hand told, but he
slipped down in endeavouring to make a hit.</p>

<p class='c022'>4.—Inglis was piping a little, but not at
all dismayed. He was a complete receiver-general;
he would have returned many
favours, but Turner did not accept them.
This was a good round, yet Turner went
down weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>5 to 10.—The fighting was all on the side
of Turner; the taking on the part of Inglis.
In all these rounds the superiority of the Old
One was evident.</p>

<p class='c022'>11.—“Come, Scroggins’s ruin,” said Josh.,
“we are at home; we have won it.” Turner
nobbed his opponent with the utmost ease;
in fact, he had everything his own way again
in this round, but went down rather weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>12.—Turner again made play right and
left with great success; he also stopped
Inglis in the most beautiful style of the art.
The game of Inglis was, however, so good
that he presented himself in the most resolute
way, and in a sharp exchange of blows
Turner went down. Inglis was nearly falling,
but caught by his second. (“Bravo!
well done both sides!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>13.—Turner did as he pleased in regard to
hitting; nevertheless, Inglis was not to be
got rid of; his youth and stamina were his
safeguards. Turner down. (The Bermondsey
boys did not know how to express their
approbation of Turner’s conduct in terms
strong enough.)</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>14.—Inglis could not plant any effective
hits; if his blows could have reached their
destination, a change might have soon been
witnessed in the fight. Turner’s one, two,
was well directed, and he also put in a heavy
body blow. The Old One showed weakness
and went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>15.—“If Ned does not tire,” said an old
ring-goer, “he must win the battle; but he
has too much work to perform.” Inglis could
not keep the Old One’s hands out of his face,
and appeared rather distressed. Turner
down, getting weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>16.—The superior science displayed by
Ned was the admiration of all the spectators.
It is true Inglis now and then planted a
blow, but it was not of sufficient consequence
to reduce the activity of Turner. In closing,
Turner got the throw. (A great shout from
the Bermondsey lads.)</p>

<p class='c022'>17.—“A fine old cock this Ned is,” said
Josh.; “this is the weather for the old cocks
to tip it them.” Inglis was advised to bore
in upon Turner, as he was getting weak;
but the young one lost ground by this attempt.
He was hit away three successive
times on the nob; in fact, he stood still for
an instant quite confused, but, with game
never excelled, he returned to fight till Turner
went down.</p>

<p class='c022'>18.—Inglis rushed in, and bored Ned
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>19.—Inglis repeated this conduct, but
Turner stopped the feather-bed hero, by hitting
up as he was rushing in. Turner down.</p>

<p class='c022'>20.—This was a sharp round, but highly
important to Turner. Inglis was floored by
a tremendous left handed hit on the side of
his head. (It is impossible to describe the
applause which followed.)</p>

<p class='c022'>21.—Inglis came to the scratch piping.
Turner nobbed his opponent with success,
but the strength of the Old One was going.
Turner down.</p>

<p class='c022'>22.—Turner met Inglis in the middle of
the head, punished him in all directions, and
had he not missed a well-aimed blow, in all
probability the fight would have been at an
end. Turner went down from exertion.</p>

<p class='c022'>23.—Nothing. A struggle, and both down
without a blow.</p>

<p class='c022'>24.—Inglis was bleeding copiously; nevertheless,
he bored in and received several
jobbers, till both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>25.—Turner planted four successive blows
on Inglis’s face; in fact, the Old One had
too much work to do. Turner down.</p>

<p class='c022'>26.—This was a tremendous round on both
sides. Inglis, although hit to death nearly,
would not be shook off, but kept fighting
like a hero till he was thrown. (“What a
round! Here’s a fight! Why it is worth
going to see, if it had been five hundred
miles from London!”)</p>

<p class='c022'>27.—It appeared to the feather-bed hero
that he had no chance to win without boring
his opponent, and he rushed in till both
went down, Inglis undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>28.—This was a tremendous fighting
round, and Inglis was hit away three or four
times from his opponent. In going down,
Inglis fell over Turner.</p>

<p class='c022'>29.—At the ropes Turner was as good as
Inglis, till both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>30.—Inglis appeared extremely bad, and
several of the judges thought Turner must
now win. The feather-bed maker was jobbed
about his already damaged head, and he
slipped down quite weak.</p>

<p class='c022'>31.—Both down. In the act of giving, the
blow alighted on Inglis’s body after he was
down. “Foul! foul!” “Fair! fair!” It
most certainly was not an intentional foul
hit on the part of Turner, and the referee
pronounced it so.</p>

<p class='c022'>32.—The face of Turner appeared little, if
any, the worse for fighting. Inglis again
napped it as he was boring in to mill. Both
down, Inglis undermost.</p>

<p class='c022'>33.—“The Elephant and Castle is yours,”
said Josh., “if you win, Ned.” Inglis was
getting a little better, and Turner received
more punishment in this round than in any
of the preceding ones. Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>34.—Nothing. A struggle, and both on
the ground.</p>

<p class='c022'>35 to 38.—In all these rounds the nobbing
system was pursued with the greatest success
by Turner; and had not Inglis been one of
the gamest men that ever pulled a shirt off,
he must have been licked long before this
period of the battle. But the feather-bed
hero would not be denied; and his courage,
seconded by his fine stamina, enabled him
to continue the battle, under the idea that
the Old One could not last. Inglis fell
heavily in the ropes on Turner.</p>

<p class='c022'>39.—It was the astonishment of every person
round the ropes to witness Turner take
the lead in the superior manner he did over
a fine young man, and a boxer who had had
some experience in the prize ring, having
defeated Deaf Davis and George Curtis.
Turner, in order to spoil the boring in of
Inglis, hit up; and whenever the Old One
caught his nob the claret followed in profusion.
Turner went down owing to his great
exertions.</p>

<p class='c022'>40.—This was a terrific round. Inglis
would not be denied, although frequently
nobbed away. Both down. (Randall, elated
with the success of Turner, offered, in the
warmth of his heart, £10 to £2. “I will
take it,” said Inglis’s brother. Time was
called, and the bet was not made.)</p>

<p class='c022'>41.—The sun at this period was very
powerful. Turner appeared languid while
sitting on the knee of his second, but when
fighting he seemed all energy. Inglis missed
a terrific blow that might have brought the
battle to a speedy termination. Turner
down.</p>

<p class='c022'>42.—Notwithstanding the state of fatigue
which Turner laboured under, and which
could not be kept from the spectators, he
nobbed Inglis with the utmost ease. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>young one was hit to a stand-still, and
Turner was too tired to follow him. At the
ropes Turner had also the best of it, till
both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>43.—“Go in, Inglis,” from his friends;
“you can’t lose if you do.” Inglis took the
advice of his friends, and went in, fighting
pell-mell, till Turner went down. (Four to
one upon the young one.)</p>

<p class='c022'>44.—This round had nearly decided the
battle in favour of Turner. Hit for hit for a
short time, when Turner knocked his opponent
to a stand-still between the ropes.
Turner, resolved not to give half a chance
away, came again and planted another
heavy nobber in the middle of the feather-bed
hero’s nob; but Inglis’s out-and-out
game brought him through his trouble, and
he fought like a lion till Turner went down.
(The approbation bestowed upon Turner was
immense. It was also “Bravo, Inglis! your
fellow is not to be met with every day in the
week.”)</p>

<p class='c022'>45.—Inglis was determined to reduce the
strength of his opponent, and again bored
in; but this rush always cost him something,
and Turner liberally discharged the account.
Both down.</p>

<p class='c022'>46.—Inglis again napped it in going in, but
returned a heavy body hit. Turner fought
at every point to win, but his strength could
not keep pace with his skill, and he went
down exhausted. “Take the good Old One
away; if he wins he cannot raise himself
higher in the estimation of the fancy,” exclaimed
several friends; “the chance is
against him.”</p>

<p class='c022'>47 and last.—This was a well fought
round, although both men were distressed.
Inglis was, however, a fresh man compared
with his opponent. Turner had the best of
the milling as usual, but went down worn
out. While sitting on the knee of his second
several persons requested that he might not
fight any more. Harry Holt jumped into
the ring, and throwing up his hat, observed,
“Permit me, gentlemen, to give in for
Turner.” One hour and eighteen minutes
had elapsed. Inglis left the ropes, but he
instantly returned into the ring to shake
hands with those hands which had so liberally
distributed punishment only a few
seconds previous. We wish sincerely that
the inhabitants of all the countries in the
world would imitate such a noble example
in the moment of victory.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='sc'>Remarks.</span>—“Othello’s occupation’s gone!”
Indeed, Turner may apply to himself the
words—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c028'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“I’ve seen the day</div>
      <div class='line'>That, with this little arm and this good fist,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve made my way through more impediments</div>
      <div class='line'>Than twenty times your stop.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>Yes; and we have “seen the day”—that
day when Turner overcame the undaunted
Scroggins; that day, also, when he stood
before the accomplished Randall two hours
and twenty minutes; and likewise that day
when he conquered Jack Martin. We cannot
offer an insult to a brave man, and it is
far from our intention even to wound his
feelings; but on any of the above days what
chance would Inglis have stood with Turner?
The fact is, Ned was not licked; he was
tired, worn out, and Nature refused to
second his efforts. Inglis won the battle
fairly, and according to the rules of pugilism.
Indeed, the fight was one of the best specimens
of milling skill ever witnessed, and the
courage displayed by Turner was of the
highest order. It is but common justice
also to state, that Inglis’s manliness, game,
coolness, and honourable conduct throughout
the battle placed him high in the list of
boxers.</p>

<p class='c013'>By an unpardonable oversight “Boxiana” (see p. 115, vol. v.) omits at
this place all mention of Turner and Inglis’s second battle, on the 9th of
November following, and gives an epistolary challenge from Inglis to Turner
as being penned “a few weeks after the above battle,” i.e., the first fight, so
that Inglis is made to challenge the man he had conquered. The second
fight will be found in the memoir of Turner, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 391. After his defeat

<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Pietro Torrigiano’s history has an English interest. He was certainly a “fighting man.”
While serving as a volunteer in the army of Pope Alexander VI. he modelled some bronze figures
for some Florentine merchants, who invited him to go with them to England. Here he was a
favourite with “bluff King Hal,” who employed Torrigiano to execute the tomb of his father,
Henry VII. in Westminster Abbey, for which he received the then large sum of £1,000.
Employed to execute a sarcophagus for Cardinal Wolsey—the Ipswich butcher’s son—his work
(once intended to enclose the coffin of Henry VIII. at Windsor) by the “irony of fate” was destined
to enshrine the remains of a greater English hero. Nelson lies beneath the dome of St Paul’s in the
sarcophagus sculptured by Torrigiano for Wolsey, his inner coffin being made from a piece of the
French flagship <em>L’Orient</em>, blown up at the battle of the Nile. Torrigiano died in Spain in the prisons
of the Inquisition, having been condemned as a sacrilegious heretic for demolishing a “statue of the
Virgin,” which having been paid inadequately for by a niggardly nobleman, the Duke of Arcoss, he
broke in pieces with his mallet. The incensed grandee had him arrested, and Torrigiano, to avoid
being roasted at an <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">auto da fé</span></i>, refused food and so perished, A.D. 1522.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. An intelligent correspondent of <cite>The Sporting Life</cite> newspaper, in a series of letters from
Germany, written in July, 1863, gives a graphic and blood-tinted picture of “How the
Students fight at Heidelberg,” which we would commend to the perusal of the pedagogues
of our public schools. We have space for no more than a few fragmentary sentences, but the
whole is worth serious thought on the part of those who “teach the ingenuous youth of
modern nations.” The writer says:—“I will now describe to you three duels, out of many I
have witnessed. The first with the sabre, the other two with <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schlagers</span></i>. The first was between
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">præses</span></i>, or head man of one of the principal corps, and an officer in the German
army. It appears that the officer was at one time a student in the University of Heidelberg,
which he quitted to enter the German service. Being quartered at Mannheim, which is
close to Heidelberg, he determined to revisit the place, when, for some reason or other unknown
to me, he was at once drawn into a duel by the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">præses</span></i> of the corps. Allow me to
remark, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</span></i>, that an unfortunate student was killed here in a sabre-duel some three
or four months ago. A court of inquiry was held, and it was proved by the medical men
that the deceased had a remarkably thin skull, which would easily have been fractured by
the slightest blow, a fall, or anything of that sort. The result was that all parties were
acquitted. But I must return to my sabre-duel. While I was passing through Heidelberg,
Old “Puggy” came and told me there would be a sabre-duel early the next morning in the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ingle Suisse</span></i>, or “Angels’ Meadow,” a small meadow up in the mountains, surrounded by
trees, and where all the <em>sabre</em> and <em>pistol</em> duels came off. The “Angels’ Meadow” is about
ten minutes walk from the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hirsch Gasse</span></i>. I suppose it has derived its name from its extreme
beauty, but I think the “Devil’s Meadow” would be a more appropriate name, for during
the last twenty years no end of fatal duels have taken place there. I took care to be on the
ground early, in order to get a view, which I did by mounting a tree. The attendance was
very small, as only a limited number are allowed to be present at a duel which is likely to be
attended with loss of life. Each man arrived on the ground in a carriage, the student being
accompanied by the University doctor, while the officer had a medical friend. While the
seconds and umpires were arranging preliminaries, the men were prepared by their respective
doctors. The combatants in this case were prepared as follows:—A leather pad to protect
the stomach, and a woollen one guarded the lower parts. The sword arm was covered
as usual, and a leather apron put on. The whole upper part of the body was left open to
attack. The ring was made, the seconds, umpire, and referee took up their respective positions,
and the two doctors undoing their cases of instruments, laid them on the ground ready
for any emergency. The terms were that the men, if able to scratch, were to fight fifteen
minutes, not including rests and stoppages. The umpire of the student (the student being
the challenger) now prepared to give the word. Previous to this, a sabre, with schlager
handles, was handed to each man. At the word <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Silentium</span></i>, you might have heard a pin drop.
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gebunden</span></i>, or the order to bind them, was then given, and a silk handkerchief was tied round
the wrist, and fastened to the handle. <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gebunden ist</span></i> was the reply, which means, “bound it
is.” <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Auf de mensur</span></i>, “go into position and scratch,” <em>Faretz</em>, “ready,” and <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Los</span></i>, “go at it,”
were called, and at it they went with a will, the guard used being the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schlager</span></i>-guard, and not
the English sword exercise. Two or three rounds were fought, when the officer got a fearful
wound on the side of the head. The round was of course over, and after a few restoratives
had been administered, silence was again called. I may as well state here, once and for all,
that this was the only wound the officer got; not so with the student, the wounds he received
about the head were of a fearful character, and round after round he came up. The time
having expired, the student was carried to his carriage; and, owing to the injuries received,
he could not leave his room for several months. When he left his room, he went to the seaside.
It is needless for me to say that both of them will carry the marks of this contest to
the grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was on April 10, during vacation, and while there were scarcely any students in
Heidelberg, I was sitting at my window, and saw four or five students go towards the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hirsch
Gasse</span></i>; I followed them, and when I arrived there the men were stripping. All being in
readiness, they were led out of the house, each arm being carefully supported by the seconds.
One of these gentlemen was a student from Munich, the other was a Heidelberger, and the
men were placed opposite to each other. Silence was called, and the fight began. The first
round occupied considerably less than half a minute, and was finished by the seconds springing
in and terminating the round, because one of the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schlagers</span></i> was bent. The second round
followed without any result. The combatants are never allowed to be in <em>mensur</em> more than
three-quarters of a minute—scarcely ever half a minute: these short rounds are done to rest
the arm. In the third round, the Munich man got a cut on the cheek, a <em>Bluticher</em>, or “a
blood,” was the cry. The seconds cried “halt!” and “a blood” was scored to the Heidelberg
student. The fourth round was a teazer for the Munich man, for he got his nose divided
clean in two. No surgeon could have done it better: you could have laid one half back on
one cheek, and the other half on the other. After this, the Munich man lost his nerve, and
every round he only came up to be receiver-general. At last he got a fearful cut behind the
head, dividing an artery. Seeing this, the surgeon immediately stopped the duel, after they
had been at it seven minutes (fifteen minutes was the time they had to fight). The wounded
man was taken inside the inn, where every necessary attention was paid him which his
condition required. I never saw the man again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The second <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schlager</span></i> duel which I saw was between a Prussian and a Schwabian: both fine
men. The morning was a wet one, so they fought in a cart-shed. Having gone into a detailed
account of two other duels, it will not be necessary for me to do so in this one; suffice it to
say, the surgeon made them fight out the full time (fifteen minutes), and the Prussian got no
less than six ugly cuts about the head; fearful gashes they were. He had to keep his bed;
and, like most of these duellists, will carry the marks to the grave. As he was led out of the
shed, he presented a piteous spectacle; and I only wish some of the detractors of the P.R.
could have seen him as I did. These two <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">schlager</span></i> duels are good average samples.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The writer adds, after some sensible remarks on these sickening and murderous savageries,
“I write thus strongly, because I cannot and will not believe that any one who has the good
of his country at heart can decry a well-conducted P.R., as it might be if legalised, or at the
least winked at and tolerated.” As to the fatal encounters with knife, rifle, and revolver in
the Transatlantic States, they stain almost every sheet of their journalism.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. As it would overload the page with notes to give authorities for these remarks, we may
observe that the opinions upon pugilism of the celebrated Mr. Windham, Mr. Harvey Combe,
Sir Henry Smith, the Duke of Hamilton, Francis Duke of Bedford, Lord Yarmouth, Mr.
Barber Beaumont, Sir John Sinclair, the first Lord Lowther, and other legislators of both
Houses, will be found under the periods with which they were contemporary, together with
the dicta of justices and judges as occasion called them forth. Anecdotes and extracts from
the writings or speeches of Dr. Johnson, Dr. Parr, Dr. Drury, Adam Smith, Sir Walter
Scott (in <cite>Paul’s Letters to his Kinsfolk</cite>), Professor Wilson, Lord Byron, Tom Moore, Sir
Robert Peel (the late), and other admirers of the pugilate, are scattered in the places where
they appropriately occur.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. On this point the Hon. Grantley Fitzhardinge Berkeley, M.P. for Gloucester, has expressed
himself with outspoken candour in “A Letter on the Sports of the People, and their
Moral Effects,” which is invaluable as the testimony of one who has shared in the sports
and studied the customs of his countrymen. He says:—“Looking at a mere prize-fight got
up by the backers and friends of each party, it seems, in its abstract position, to be an useless
brutality for two men, having no personal cause of quarrel, to bruise each other for the possession
of gold; but, regarding it in another light, as the necessary display of a fair standard
of combat, by the rights and regulations of which, throughout the country, all quarrels
determined by personal conflict are to be settled, in this light it assumes a character of safe
and wholesome public example, which its most strenuous opposers cannot with justice deny.
In my mind, then, the prize fight and fair boxing-match are the means of teaching the
people to become advocates for honest and gallant decisions in all cases of quarrel, and that
the encouragement of the use of the fist is the greatest antidote that can be offered to the
revengeful and dastardly resort to the assassin’s knife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In freedom from war, in the retirement and blessings of the country, there are no gallant
deeds to keep alive the emulation and courage of the English peasant; then I hold that <em>any
amusement</em> which tends to the display of personal gallantry, is calculated to be beneficial to
the human mind. In spite of all the outcry raised by self-dubbed humane societies, and the
abuse to which they often stretch the power vested in them for better purposes; in spite of
the sickly preachings of diseased and over-sensitive minds, there is no set of people more
angry with the fact of two armies being in presence of each other without fighting, than
those whose health or inclinations confine them to the tea-table and fireside, and who would
faint at the mere sight of their own blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the man who cannot leave home, that cries out for war; it is the man who has no
chance of bleeding, that calls for blood. A paper on the breakfast-table, which brings a
return of thousands slain, is, to the appetite of those sickly sophists, an agreeable stimulant.
‘Humanity’ makes a capital banner for a cavilist, ignorant of the matter of the subject he
condemns, to march under; and ‘no cruelty’ is a cry like the ‘no popery’ cry, which gathers
together hosts of unthinking people ready to arraign and pull down they know not what.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The shrivelled penman, whether clerk or layman, whose thews and sinews have wasted
through inactivity, sits at his desk and condemns recreations, pastimes, and pleasures,
the value of which he has never known, and the loss of which, in consequence, is immaterial
to him; while hosts of others, conscious of their own more secret mental deformities, are
zealous to hang charges of immorality on any superficially available corner of the characters
of their neighbours, for the sole purpose of sustaining one reputation on the ruins of
another.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. It is a curious statistical fact that of twenty murders, accompanied with brutal violence,
committed in 1862‒3‒4, the writer traced no less than eleven to inhabitants of England not
native born. A more recent atrocity, the railway murder of Mr. Briggs, we owe to a German
immigrant; the five preceding ones (out of eleven) to Irishmen, who bear a proportion to
Englishmen as 5 to 150, or 1 in 30 of the population. Then comes in close sequence, the
brutal assassination and mutilation of a German (Fuhrup) by his countryman Karl Kohl;
and later we find recorded a knife and shillalah fight between Italians (Gregorio Mogni and
Serafino Pelizzioni), who among them stabbed several persons and killed an Irishman, one
Michael Harrington, the initiatory feud being the merits of Garibaldi on the Italian side, and
his Holiness Pio Nono on the Irish.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. The “Ring” in Hyde Park (not the drive so called) was formed in 1723, by “order of
his Majesty,” and encircled by a fence. It was situated about 300 yards from Grosvenor
Gate. The area is still visible—a circle of very old trees belted by a plantation of younger
ones. It was the scene of many impromptu conflicts, especially among the “chairmen” and
“linkmen” of the two first Georges’ reigns, and the early part of the third. Fights were
stopped here by the “Bow-street myrmidons” towards the close of the last century, and the
ring itself obliterated in 1820.</p>

Doctor himself was not only an advocate, but a practitioner of the fistic art. His strength
and personal courage were undoubted, as well as his humanity. We have the authority of
his biographers for his knock-down of Davies, the bookseller, in King-street, Covent Garden,
and among the anecdotes of the day current and printed, is one of his successfully “instructing”
a bullying drayman who was beating a cripple; as for his humanity and strength,
we have the well-known and oft-repeated fact of his carrying pick-a-back (despite his
prejudice against Scotchmen,) a disabled Scottish beggar to the hospital in Crane-court,
Fleet-street.</p>

matches above alluded to. Here, too (afterwards called Saville House), George the Third was
proclaimed, on the 26th October, 1760, and received the great bodies of the State. Its

There are some odd points of resemblance in Pettit’s fighting and that of Heenan in his
Wadhurst fight with Tom King, although one was fought on turf the other on a stage.
Heenan did not, however, “rogue” it like the Frenchman, and walk off, but “took his

<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. George Meggs, the collier, was from the pugilistic nursery of Bristol. After this surreptitious
seizure of the championship, he returned to his native place, we presume, for in July,
1762, we find him fighting “a pitched battle for a considerable sum (“Fistiana” says £100)
with one Millsom, a baker, of the rival city of Bath.” This came off at Calne in Wiltshire,
when, after a fierce battle of forty minutes, Millsom was acknowledged the conqueror. In
the next month (August, 1762), Meggs, having challenged Millsom to a second combat, was
a second time beaten.</p>

<p class='c007'>Parfitt Meggs, noticed hereafter, a noted west country boxer, also surrendered to Millsom.
Parfitt afterwards beat a namesake of the retired champion Slack (whose Christian name
was John, not Jem), in the year 1765, at Lansdown, near Bath, which has made a mess in
more than one “history.” In “Fistiana” (1864 edit.), under Meggs (Parfitt) are several fights,
including two defeats by Tom Tyne (1787) and a victory over Joe Ward in 1790, about all
which history is silent, while under Tom Tyne we are told he was twice beaten by Mendoza;
when and where we know not. He was, however, beaten by Bill Darts (afterwards champion)
at Shepton Mallett, in 1764, which does not appear under Meggs’ name.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. “Tom Juchau, the paviour,” once bid fair to seize the championship—on June 20th,
1764. His name in pugilistic circles was “Disher;” how derived, we might in vain inquire.
His first fight of importance was with Charles Cohant (or Coant), a butcher, who had fought
several severely-contested battles. Cohant, being the best known man, was the favourite,
and the contemporary account says, “During the first twenty-five minutes ‘Disher’ was
scarcely able to give him a single blow, but was knocked down several times. At thirty-five
minutes odds were so high that money was offered at any rate. At this time Disher (Tom
Juchau) changed his mode of fighting, and giving Cohant a most tremendous blow, by which
he fell; the odds immediately changed in his favour. After this they fought but four rounds,
when Disher, having played in several dreadful blows, Cohant yielded, acknowledging himself
to be vanquished. The fight lasted forty-seven minutes.” There is a Spartan brevity,
an heroic simplicity, and a simple trust in the reports of these olden fights, which is truly
“refreshing” (we believe that is the tabernacle phrase) in these days of prose-showering and
persiflage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next report is equally commendable for its brevity. “On August the 27th (1765),
Millsom, who had defeated the two Meggs (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>), fought a battle with Thomas Juchau,
the paviour, at Colney, near St. Alban’s, in which he failed to enjoy his usual triumph,
Juchau proving his conqueror.” After half a page of undated rigmarole, headed “Tom
Juchau,” Pierce Egan says, vol. i., p. 74, “The paviour was now considered a first-rate man,
and soon matched himself against some of the most distinguished pugilists.” We cannot find
that he ever fought again.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. Lyons (champion, 1769) has no mention of his exploits, except his conquest of the heroic
Bill Darts, June 27, 1769, for the championship. For twenty-five minutes Darts had it all
his own way, and ten to one was laid upon him, when Lyons recovered second wind, and in
forty-five minutes wrested the championship from him. The battle took place at Kingston-upon-Thames.
No other notable fight is credited to Lyons.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r34'>34</a>. Elisha Crabbe, though a professor of some notoriety, does not take much rank by this
conquest over a boxer of upwards of fifty years of age. His next fight was with Bob Watson,
of Bristol, June 9, 1788 (see Appendix to Period II., in the memoir of <span class='sc'>Watson</span>), wherein
he was beaten, but not disgraced. His last fight was with Tom Tyne (see <span class='sc'>Tyne</span>), wherein
he was also defeated. Elisha, who was in height 5 feet 8 inches, was a man of great
muscular power. For many years he filled the responsible position of a peace officer at the
Mansion House of the City of London. He resigned this and became a licensed victualler
in Duke’s Place. He was a civil, obliging man, and always an object of popular attraction
among the people of his own persuasion. He died suddenly on board the Gravesend packet,
June 9, 1809, on his return to London, and was buried with Jewish tokens of respect.</p>

“May 11, 1773, a boxing match took place at the Riding School, Three Hats, Islington,
between John Pearce and John White, both shoemakers, for £10 a-side. At the commencement
of the combat White seemed to have somewhat the advantage, but Pearce
having recovered his wind, and given White several severe falls, was on the point of winning,
when the high constable and his attendants mounted the stage, and put an end to the
contest.”—<cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>, May 13th.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. As even an opponent of so good a boxer, Love’s name deserves a line or two. On
January 14, 1788, after the fights of Johnson and Ryan and Mendoza and Humphries had
brought back to pugilism the highest patronage, Bill Love and Denis Ketcher, an Irish
boxer, fought for 20 guineas. Love was seconded by W. Savage, and Ketcher by his brother.
“There were not less than 10,000 spectators of this fight, who were highly surprised and
gratified by the dexterity of Ketcher. In size and strength Love was superior, but in forty-five
minutes he was obliged to yield the laurel to the superior adroitness of his opponent.”
(“Pancratia,” p. 77.) Love’s next appearance was more successful. On January 22, only
eight days after his defeat by Ketcher, Love fought George Ring (generally misprinted
King), the Bath baker, a well-known pugilist, whose defeat of Edwards, on his first arrival
in London, had made him much talked about. Love beat him cleverly in thirty-seven
minutes, in “the Hay Fields, Bloomsbury.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r40'>40</a>. Called Bill Ward in “Recollections” and in “Pancratia.” His name is correctly given
in “Fistiana.” Warr beat Wood (Captain Robinson’s coachman) at Navestock, Essex,
December 31, 1788; was twice beaten by Mendoza (see <span class='sc'>Mendoza</span>); beat Stanyard, “a
pugilist of celebrity from Birmingham,” for 100 guineas, in ten rounds, thirteen minutes, at
Colnbrook, October 26, 1792.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f41'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r41'>41</a>. It would be injustice to omit a short sketch of what our Yankee friends would call so
“tall” a boxer as Isaac Perrins. His immense strength was “yoked with a lamb-like disposition.”
In Birmingham, where he had long followed his occupation as foreman of a
large manufactory, he was respected by his employers, and beloved by the workmen under
him. Perrins was far from an illiterate man. In his general conversation he was intelligent,
cheerful, and communicative, and possessed of a considerable share of discernment,
which, after he quitted his calling as a coppersmith at Birmingham, and became a publican
at Manchester, was of great service to him in business. His house was well attended by
customers of a superior class. Isaac, too, had a natural taste for music, and, at one period
of his life, was the leader of a country choir in psalmody. In company, Perrins was
facetious, full of anecdote, and never tardy in giving his song; and was a strong instance in
his own person, among many others which might be cited, if necessary, that it does not
follow as a matter of course that all pugilists are blackguards! The following anecdote from
a work entitled “The Itinerant,” not only places the good temper and amazing strength of
Perrins in a conspicuous point of view, but exhibits one of the peculiar traits of an erratic
histrionic genius, whose reckless riot ruined and extinguished his higher gifts. “It happened
that Perrins, the noted pugilist, made one of the company this evening. He was a
remarkably strong man, and possessed of great modesty and good nature; the last scene
took such an effect on his imagination, that he laughed immoderately. Cooke’s attention was
attracted, and turning towards him with his most bitter look, ‘What do you laugh at, Mr.
Swabson, hey? Why, you great lubber-headed thief, Johnson would have beat two of you!
laugh at me! at George Cooke! come out, you scoundrel!’ The coat was soon pulled off,
and, putting himself in an attitude, he exclaimed, ‘This is the arm that shall sacrifice you.’
Perrins was of a mild disposition, and, knowing Cooke’s character, made every allowance,
and answered him only by a smile, till aggravated by language and action the most gross,
he very calmly took him in his arms as though he had been a child, set him down in the
street, and bolted the door. The evening was wet, and our hero without coat or hat, unprepared
to cope with it; but entreaty for admission was vain, and his application at the window
unattended to. At length, grown desperate, he broke several panes, and, inserting his
head through the fracture, bore down all opposition by the following witticism: ‘Gentlemen,
I have taken some <em>panes</em> to gain admission, pray let me in, for <em>I see through my error</em>.’ The
door was opened, dry clothes procured, and about one o’clock in the morning we sent him
home in a coach.” Despite the second-hand wit, the credit remains with the pugilist.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the “Annual Register,” under date of December 10, 1800, we read, “Died at Manchester,
aged 50, Mr. Isaac Perrins, engine-worker. This pugilistic hero will ever be
remembered for the well-contested battle he fought with the celebrated Johnson, in the
month of October, 1789. Perrins possessed most astonishing muscular power, which rendered
him well calculated for a bruiser, to which was united a disposition the most placid
and amiable. His death was occasioned by too violently exerting himself in assisting to save
life and property at a fire in Manchester. He was sincerely lamented by all who knew him.”
Perrins needs no further epitaph than this tribute of <em>one</em> who knew him.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r43'>43</a>. Those who witnessed the memorable third fight between Caunt and Bendigo (at Sutfield

<div class='footnote' id='f45'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r45'>45</a>. Jacombs, whose provincial triumphs are unrecorded, was a strong rough, with an
Englishman’s heirdom, unyielding pluck. We find only one other notice in the journals of
the time. “March 10 (1790). A desperate contest was fought at Stoke Golding, near
Coventry, between Jacombs, the Warwickshire boxer, and Payne, of Coventry. At setting-to
Jacombs was the favourite, but after a most severe conflict of two hours, in which the
combatants contested ninety-five rounds, and during which both the combatants were
several times thrown from the stage, Payne was declared victorious. The conduct of Payne
was cool, but admirably courageous, whilst that of Jacombs seemed brutally passionate.
He seemed to depend more upon driving and bruising his opponent against the railings than
fair and open fighting with the fists.” We regret to say that Jacombs has had too many
successors in this unmanly art, even with the less dangerous ropes and stakes of the modern
ring.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f46'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r46'>46</a>. Tom Tring in person, but not in physiognomy, resembled the late burly and clumsy
boxer Ben Caunt. He was, however, a civil, inoffensive, and mild looking giant. He was the
original of several Academicians’ drawings and paintings of Hercules. “He challenged all
England” (<em>except his friend</em> Tom Johnson—a judicious exception), “for one thousand
guineas;” so do the advertising hair-dressers: but when Pierce asks us to believe that poor
Tring’s “qualities as a pugilist were of a most tremendous nature, and few men appeared who
were capable of resisting his mighty prowess,” and of his being “clad in the rich <em>paraphernalia</em>
(which of the princesses married him?) <em>of royalty</em>,” we begin to ask ourselves whether we
are reading the history of Tom Thumb. To support this magniloquent introduction, we are
told he beat Tom Pratt, “a very formidable man,” in 1787, a guinea to four shillings,
“Pratt ran away, leaving Tom in possession of the ring.” We find, instead of this, under
date of August 19th, 1787, that “a boxing match was contested on Kennington Common,
between Jacob Doyle, the Irish boxer, and Tom Tring, which the latter won with ease.
Tring is said to be the finest made man in England, and the talents of several of the first
artists have been employed to delineate the symmetry of his person. As a boxer he possessed
little science, but good courage.” (Quoted in “Pancratia,” p. 72). A terrible “street fight”
with one Norfolk, a bricklayer, is here improvised, to introduce his thrashing by Big Ben.
Poor Tring was another of the victims of the heartless dandy and unprincipled egotist
miscalled “the first gentleman of Europe,” without a particle of the gentleman in his whole
composition. Tring obtained a precarious living as a model to Sir Joshua Reynolds, Hooper,
Sir William Beechey, and others, and earned a crust as a street porter. He was a civil
inoffensive fellow; in height six feet two inches, and weighing fifteen stone in prime condition.
He died in the pursuit of his humble calling in the year 1815.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r51'>51</a>. Mendoza’s last ring battle may be considered as that with John Jackson in 1795. His
return to the ring to fight out a quarrel with Harry Lee, in 1806, and the foolish exhibition
in 1820 with old Tom Owen, are solecisms, and do not disturb the arrangement by Periods.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f52'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r52'>52</a>. A contemporary writer, in 1790, says of him: “Mendoza is a pugilist better initiated in
the theory of boxing than perhaps any of his cotemporaries, and has produced some exceedingly
expert pupils. In his manner there is more neatness than strength, and it has been
said, more show than service; his blows are in general deficient in force, but given with
astonishing quickness, and he is allowed to strike oftener, and stop more dexterously, than
any other man; he is extremely well formed in the breast and arms, but his loins are very
weak; his wind is good, and he possesses excellent bottom.”</p>

selection, as, with the exception of Tom Tyne (Nos. 18, 19), whose two defeats by Mendoza
are unrecorded, and those with an asterisk, not one name ever figures as fighting anybody
else on any discoverable occasion.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f56'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r56'>56</a>. Mendoza was at that period fifty-seven years of age, while Owen was nearly six years
younger; an important difference—supposing all other circumstances equal—at such an
advanced (we had almost said absurd) time of life for a fistic exhibition.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r58'>58</a>. Sam Martin, known as the Bath Butcher, fought many good battles in “the West
Countrie.” On his coming to London, however, he was unlucky in being pitted against such
masters of the art as Humphries and Dan Mendoza. To Sam’s battle with Humphries, the
author of “Pancratia” (p. 68), attributes “the revival of pugilism, and its high patronage.”
The result is related in the text.</p>

<p class='c007'>Martin was next matched against Mendoza. His defeat, April 17, 1787, will be found in
that boxer’s biography. His last battle of importance was with Bligh, “the Coventry
Champion,” a riband weaver of that town. It came off at Evesham, in Oxfordshire, on the
7th of April, 1791, for 50 guineas a side. George Ring, the Bath Baker, seconded Martin;
a local boxer (Brooks), picked up Bligh. Martin’s two defeats, and Bligh’s local fame, made
the latter the favourite, at six and seven to four. After a severe contest, Martin was hailed
as conqueror.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f60'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r60'>60</a>. As a matter incidental to the history of pugilism, we cannot omit a short notice of
Colonel Aston. The story has a spice of romance, and “points a moral” in favour of the
principles we are advocating. We copy the “News from India” in the <cite>World</cite> for 1799.
“Colonel Aston being for a short time absent from his regiment, a misunderstanding
occurred between Major Picton<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c009'><sup>[171]</sup></a> and Major Allan with a lieutenant. Immediately on the return
of the colonel, he was made acquainted with the affair, and wrote his opinion, in a private
letter, that the behaviour of the two majors was somewhat ‘illiberal’ to their subaltern officer.
The letter being shown, Majors P. and A. demanded a Court of Inquiry, which was refused by
the commander-in-chief, as calculated to destroy ‘that harmony among officers so essential
to the support of discipline in regiments on foreign duty.’ Major Picton now called upon
Colonel Aston to demand an explanation of the term ‘illiberal.’ Colonel Aston ‘did not
think himself bound to account for his conduct in discharge of his duty as Colonel to any
inferior officer; but if Major Picton had anything to reproach him with, as a private gentleman,
he was prepared to give him any satisfaction in his power.’ This brought it into the
domain of a private quarrel (!), and the next day they met by appointment, accompanied by
their seconds. Major Picton had the first fire: his pistol snapped, which was declared equal
to a fire by the seconds. Colonel Aston immediately fired in the air, declaring he had no
quarrel with the major.” Would not a rational man think this punctilious foolery was
settled; but no! We continue our quotation. “Notwithstanding the kindly manner in
which this affair had been apparently settled, to the reciprocal satisfaction of the code of the
duello, Major Allan the next day demanded satisfaction for the private opinion expressed by
the colonel of his conduct. A similar answer was returned, that the colonel denied his right
to call upon him to explain any act of his official duty; that he was at all times ready to
vindicate his private conduct, but at the same time was unconscious of having offended
Major A. The latter, however, assumed a tone of vehemence and authority, which rendered
the meeting on the part of the colonel unavoidable. Major Allan fired the first shot—the
seconds did not perceive the ball had taken effect. The colonel, having received the
fire, appeared unhurt, stood erect, and with the greatest composure levelled his pistol with a
steady hand, shewing he had power to fire on his antagonist. He then leisurely drew it
back, and laying it across his breast, said, ‘I am shot through the body; I believe the
wound is mortal, and therefore decline returning the fire: for it never shall be said that the
last act of my life was dictated by a spirit of revenge.’ He sat down on the ground, was
carried home, where he languished in excessive agony for several days, and without a
murmur expired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Colonel Harvey Aston was brother to the pretty Mrs. Hodges, well known in the sporting
world. He married Miss Ingram, the daughter of Lady Irwin, and sister to the Marchioness
of Hertford, Lady William Gordon, Lady Ramsden, and Mrs. Meynell, whom he left with a
young family to deplore this melancholy accident.” The chivalrous honour, manly forbearance,
and moderation of this staunch patron of pugilism shines through every phase of this
deplorable case of manslaughter. We call things by their right names.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f61'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r61'>61</a>. Fewterel is said by Mr. Vincent Dowling, in his obituary notice of John Jackson, to
have been a Scotchman; we think it probable from what we here give.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only other contest of Fewterel’s, worth preserving, is his battle with a Highlander, on
the Leith Ground, Edinburgh, March 23, 1793. The Highlander, whose calling was that of
an Edinburgh chairman, was reputed a phenomenon among his brethren of the Scottish
capital.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fewterel, when stripped, appeared very corpulent, and by no means in the condition in
which he fought Jackson. The Highlander was by far the finer and stronger man, and was
reported to possess wonderful readiness and courage. They set-to at about eight o’clock in
the morning, and the first knock-down blow was given by Fewterel, who sent his antagonist
a surprising distance, there being no roped enclosure. The next round he also brought down
the Scot by a severe blow in the chest. In the next round the Highlander got in a well-hit
stroke under Fewterel’s right eye, which cut him severely. He, however, stood firm, and
kept cool. The next blow Fewterel got in, he again brought him down, and this so
enraged the Highlander, that during the remainder of the contest he never recovered his
temper. This gave Fewterel a decided advantage, and though he afterwards received many
severe blows, he constantly reduced the strength of his antagonist. At length he put in a hit
under the Highlander’s jaw that laid him senseless on the grass. Thus terminated the
contest, after thirty-five minutes. The Scot soon, however, recovered, but was unable to
walk home. The match was 50 guineas to 30 guineas. The odds were given to Fewterel,
who generously gave the man he had beaten 10 guineas, the sum he (Fewterel) was
promised if he won the battle.”—“Pancratia,” pp. 111, 112.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r63'>63</a>. That the everyday use and familiar handling of deadly weapons lead to their reckless
use, we may quote a few recent instances from the history of our descendants in America.
The horrible assassination of the great and good President Abraham Lincoln, and the
ferocious use of a “billy” and a bowie-knife upon the helpless and prostrate Mr. Secretary
Seward, his son, Major Frederick Seward, and an attendant, are offsprings of a familiarity
with daily outrages by lethal weapons, and the general resort to them to redress injury or
resent insult. The death of the assassin Booth is the culmination.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r65'>65</a>. About 1790, Lord Barrymore was in the hey-day of his riot and “larkery” at Brighton,
where the Prince of Wales had just finished that grotesque kiosk known as the Pavilion,
once the scene of royal orgies, now a cockney show-shop of London super mare. The Lord
Barrymore, who was Hooper’s patron, was the head of the family firm nicknamed Newgate,
Hellgate, and Cripplegate, from colloquial, acquired, or personal peculiarities. On hearing
these elegant sobriquets, the Prince is said to have objected to the omission of the lady sister
of the trio from this nomenclature, and ungallantly suggested the name of “Billingsgate,”
as a fourth of the family.</p>

<p class='c007'>One anecdote is too characteristic of the actors to be lost. “In one of his wild freaks, his
Lordship, from his lofty phaeton, struck with his driving whip a Mr. Donadieu, a respectable
perfumer of Brighton, who was driving in his gig, for not getting quickly enough out of his
impetuous Lordship’s way. Mr. Donadieu drove after him, but his lordship’s terrible high-bred
cattle soon distanced him. The next morning Mr. D., perceiving Lord Barrymore upon
the Steyne, in company with several sporting men, went up to him and remonstrated upon
the ungentlemanly usage he had experienced the previous day. His Lordship replied insultingly,
and struck the perfumer. The tradesman was an Englishman, and at once returned
the blow. A smart rally convinced the eccentric peer that his credit as a boxer was at stake,
for his resolute opponent drove him before his attack. Lord Barrymore tried to take an unfair
advantage, when the Prince of Wales, who had witnessed the whole fracas from a window of
the Pavilion, called out in a loud voice, ‘D——e, Barrymore, <em>fight like a man</em>!’” In the
Hon. Grantley F. Berkeley’s volumes, “My Life and Recollections” (London, Hurst and
Blackett, 1865), vol. i., pp. 49‒78, is a curious sketch of Brighton at the close of the 18th
century, with anecdotes of Colonel Hanger, Lord Barrymore, John Jackson, etc., and the
ladies whom the heir apparent delighted to honour. The specimen of the Prince’s style, in
the anecdote of the Royal Harriers, pp. 70, 71, will show that the “first gentleman of
Europe” was <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">facile princeps</span></i> in the then fashionable accomplishment of swearing. Grantley
Berkeley makes a slip in the closing lines of his notice of Lord Barrymore, which it may be
worth while to correct. He says: “A rapid career of reckless extravagance was brought to
a sudden close whilst marching with a detachment towards Dover: <em>the musket of one of his
men went off, eventually causing his</em> (Lord Barrymore’s) <em>death</em>.” We must acquit the Berkshire
militia of this charge of clumsy or intentional homicide. We extract from the memoir
of a contemporary: “Lord Barrymore was a lieutenant of the Berkshire militia stationed at
Rye, and was marching a party of French prisoners to Deal. They marched through
Folkestone to the top of the succeeding hill, and halted at a small public-house to refresh his
men and the prisoners. Admiral Macbride and General Smith met his lordship there; he
was in high spirits, and accepted an invitation to dine with them at Deal. Lord Barrymore
had marched at the head of his party from Rye; he now ordered his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet-de-chambre</span></i>, who
drove his curricle in the rear, to procure him a pipe of tobacco, saying, ‘I’ll ride and smoke
while you drive.’ He was in high glee, counted up the score with chalk on a slate, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</span></i>
Boniface; imitated Hob, from ‘Hob in the Well,’ a farce he was very partial to; treated all
about him; gave the landlady a kiss, and leaped into the curricle. He gave the fusil to his
servant, who placed it carelessly between his legs and drove off. They had scarcely proceeded
fifty yards when the piece went off. The contents entered his lordship’s right cheek,
forced out the eye, and lodged in the brain: he was pointing to the coast of France at the
moment. He lived forty minutes, groaning heavily, but never spoke again. The fusil was
loaded with swan shot; he had been killing gulls and rabbits on his way from Rye to
Folkestone. An inquest was held on the 8th of March, the verdict ‘Accidental Death.’ He
was interred on Sunday, March 17, 1793, in the chancel of the church at Wargrave.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r82'>82</a>. Pierce Egan says, “a man of the name of Bourke, a butcher.” Much confusion
has been occasioned by the absurd penchant of “the historian” (as Pierce was wont
to style himself) to Hibernicise and appropriate to Ireland the names and deeds of fistic
heroes. Teste his twist of “the Streatham Youth” into O’Neale, his ludicrous magniloquence
in the case of several Irish roughs in “Boxiana,” on whom he has expended his
slang panegyric (see <span class='sc'>Corcoran</span>, <span class='sc'>Gamble</span>, <span class='sc'>Hatton</span>, <span class='sc'>O’Donnell</span>, etc.), and his thousand
and one claims of “Irish descent” for most of his heroes. Joe Berks (spelt Bourke or
Burke in “Boxiana” and “Fistiana”) was a native of Wem, in Shropshire. He was a
powerful heavy made man, a little short of six feet high, and weighing fourteen stone. His
career was unfortunate, from being pitted against such phenomena of skill as Jem Belcher
and Henry Pearce, for his game and strength were unimpeachable. From “Pancratia,”
p. 126, under date of September, 18, 1797, we learn that Joe Berks was a cooper, and that
at that date he fought one Christian, a shoemaker, and much fancied as a boxer by the sons
of Crispin, a severe battle in Hyde Park. The contest lasted fifty-five minutes, during
which there were twenty-two rounds of hard boxing. Berks, despite a wrangle for a “foul,”
was declared the conqueror. Berks’ subsequent pugilistic career will be read in the memoirs
of his conqueror. His successive defeats by Belcher, Pearce, and Deplige, and his violent
temper, lost his patrons, and he sunk into poverty. A dishonest act, under the influence, as
it was urged in his defence, of liquor, led to his imprisonment. Here one firm friend of the
unfortunate stepped forward, John Jackson, who, by petition, procured his liberation. Berks
enlisted, and when his kind benefactor last heard of him he held the position of non-commissioned
officer in the Grenadier company of a regiment serving under the Duke of
Wellington (Sir Arthur Wellesley) in Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r102'>102</a>. There is some obscurity about this, as to whether the fight with Tom Jones, July 13,
1801, is attributable to Dutch Sam, or to Isaac Bittoon. (See <span class='sc'>Bittoon</span>.) “Boxiana,”
“Fistiana,” etc., give it to Bittoon, we suspect erroneously; for we find in a contemporary
newspaper the following:—“Monday, July 13, 1801.—A boxing match was fought on Wimbledon
Common, between Elias, a Jew, and Tom Jones. In the first twenty minutes Tom
evidently had the advantage, and during this time great sport was afforded to the amateurs
by the science displayed. Elias, however, put in a hit so forcibly behind Tom’s ear, that Tom
immediately fell, and gave up the contest.” And see “Pancratia,” p. 136, where the battle

<div class='footnote' id='f107'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r107'>107</a>. As in the interval between these two battles, Mr. Fletcher Reid, a great patron and
backer of the Belchers, paid the “debt of nature,” this seems the right place for a brief
obituary notice which we find in the journals:—“On Thursday morning, January the 24th
(1807), died, at Shepperton, Surrey, where he had resided for the last two years, Mr.
Fletcher Reid, well-known in the sporting world, particularly as one of the greatest patrons
of gymnastic genius. The evening preceding he had spent jovially amongst some select
companions, and retired to rest at rather a late hour. In the morning his servant found him
dead. Mr. Fletcher Reid was a native of Dundee, in Scotland, near to which he had succeeded
to estates, by the death of his mother, which afflicting intelligence he had received
only two days previous to his decease. He left a wife and two children, who for some time
past had resided with his mother.” The following lines, rather questionable in taste,

twenty minutes Tom evidently had the advantage, and during this time great sport had been
afforded by the excellent science displayed on both sides. Elias, however, put in a hit so
forcibly behind Tom’s ear, that he immediately fell and gave up the contest.” And see
“Pancratia,” p. 144., where the paragraph is reprinted. The Elias was, doubtless, Dutch
Sam.</p>

“On Tuesday morning, February the 18th [1794], a battle was fought between Jack
Holmes, the hackney coachman, and a manufacturer of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à-la-mode</span></i> beef, in a field behind
Gower Street, Bedford Square. After four or five tolerably good rounds, the contest was put
an end to by the cry of a foul blow. The seconds chose an umpire, Captain Hamilton, who,
greatly to the disappointment of the kiddies who lacked more fun, decided it in favour of the
beef-eater. This very much discomfited the son of Jehu, who certainly had held the whip-hand
over his antagonist the whole time, and he voluntarily offered to renew the battle for
another guinea, but his opponent declined.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f130'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r130'>130</a>. As “Boxiana” is scarce and out of print, a specimen of the inflated bombast of its
author may be amusing. The memoir of Gregson (who occupies six lines in the Chronologies),
<em>all his recorded fights having been defeats</em>, is thus headed and introduced, with a
profusion of capital letters:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<p class='c007'>“In recording the most prominent traits of the celebrated pugilists, from the earliest professors
of the gymnastic art down to the present milling æra, when passing in review,
‘Boxiana’ has found none more entitled to peculiar attention than the hero of the present
sketch.” Said sketch then starts off from Fig, glances at Broughton, George Taylor, Slack,
the ‘prodigies of valour performed by Corcoran as a bruiser;’ and refers to Humphries,
Mendoza, Bill Warr, Hooper, Jackson, Pearce, the Belchers, and Berks. Gully, Cribb, and
Molineaux too are dragged in as foils to Bob Gregson! The proëmium thus concludes:—“But,
notwithstanding the above variety of qualifications, it has been reserved for Bob Gregson
alone, from his union of pugilism and poetry, to recount the deeds of his brethren of the fist
in heroic verse (like the bards of old, in sounding the praises of their warlike champions),
whose pretensions to the former are beyond all dispute, and respecting the latter, one of the
most distinguished works of sporting celebrity has given place to the poetic effusions of his
muse.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f131'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r131'>131</a>. To many who have not the opportunity of perusing the writings of “the author of
Boxiana,” as he was wont to call himself, this criticism may appear unduly harsh: this
imputation we should be sorry to lie under. While writing these pages, two well filled
volumes have been published by the Hon. Grantley Berkeley, entitled “My Life and Recollections,”
embracing reminiscences of the first half of the present century, and of persons
and events in society. The writer is happy to have so thoroughly competent a confirmation
of his condemnation. He may premise also, that the very argot of which Pierce Egan proclaimed
himself a professor was not radically English, but the low slang of Irish ruffianism.
Mr. Grantley Berkeley says (vol. i., pp. 107, 108):—“The extravagances and absurdities of
‘Tom and Jerry’ were brought into vogue by a low-caste Irishman, known as Pierce Egan,
sometimes a newspaper reporter [only in his later day] of fights, etc., and sometimes a low
comedian in third-rate Dublin and London theatres. [He was a compositor in Smeeton’s
printing office in St. Martin’s Lane.] His ‘Life in London’ was very popular, and he
dramatised it at the Adelphi [this was done by Billy Moncrieff] with marked success. He
brought out a similar play in the Irish capital, called ‘Life in Dublin,’ and a third in the
flourishing commercial port on the Mersey, called ‘Life in Liverpool.’ His ‘Boxiana’ was
considered as a text-book on fights and fighting men; and his elaborate and exaggerated
descriptions of ‘a mill,’ as prize-fights were designated, were stuffed full of slang, the
delight of a large circle of male readers. He assisted in starting a sporting newspaper, the
still flourishing <cite>Bell’s Life in London</cite> [this is totally wrong], and subsequently an opposition
one, with a similar title. It failed, and he long outlived his reputation as an author, for he
was totally destitute of literary invention: the characters in his stories were thoroughly conventional,
and his style never rose above that of an ordinary penny-a-liner. He was a coarse-looking
man, who seemed only to have associated with the very lowest society in England and
Ireland. Indeed, he used to make boast of his familiarity with the riff-raff of both capitals.
The intense vulgarity of his writings grew distasteful; and though he produced several
works of imagination, all have sunk into oblivion. Indeed they predeceased their author a
good many years. He died totally forgotten by his once innumerable patrons, and the
literature of the ring died with him.” The last phrase rounds a period; but a second
thought would have told Mr. Berkeley that the really good ring reports which, from about
1824 to a late period, at intervals filled the columns of the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, <cite>Bell’s Life in
London</cite>, <cite>the Weekly Dispatch</cite>, and other papers, were none of them from the coarse and
illiterate pen of “the historian,” but from those of George Kent, Mr. G. Daniels; and principally
from those of Mr. Smith, Mr. V. G. Dowling, the writer of this work, and other
qualified reporters. Whether the ring itself is dead is another question, which we may now
answer in the affirmative with Mr. Grantley Berkeley.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f147'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r147'>147</a>. Jack Holmes was for many years a well known public character. In “Fistiana” he is

“the Coachman.” The latter’s only recorded battles are, that with Tom Tough (Blake),
and that with Richmond reported above.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f149'>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r152'>152</a>. The term “navvy” or “navigator,” now applied to the labourers who do the earthworks,
embankments, and excavations of our railways, seems anomalous; it, however, was derived
from the fact that the early canals, which these men dug, were called “navigations,” not only
in common speech, but in legal documents and Acts or Parliament. Those who worked on
the “navigation” were called “navigators.” The name has remained, though a viaduct has
taken the place of an aqueduct.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r153'>153</a>. This is Pierce Egan’s report. Shelton was 5 feet 10 inches; Burn (who is always by him

<div class='footnote' id='f155'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r155'>155</a>. This term perhaps may not be generally understood. To “hocus” a man is to put
something into his drink of a narcotic quality, that renders him unfit for action. On the
morning alluded to, Randall, in company with some “friends,” partook of a bottle of red
wine mulled, into which, he asserted, the sleepy potion must have been introduced by some
scoundrel of the company.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r168'>168</a>. Tom Reynolds, born at Middleton, county Armagh, Ireland, 1792, was brought up in
Covent Garden Market, where, in after years, he was a potato merchant. “Boxiana,”
vol. ii., pp. 429-441; vol. iii., pp. 458-462, gives the usual number of victories to the youthful
“Tight Irish Boy,” over “big” unknown men, and a turn-up in the Fleet Prison with
George Head, (in which Reynolds was defeated in nine minutes, says “Fistiana,” while
Pierce Egan says he was victorious). Tom’s greatest exploit, however, was his conquest of
Aby Belasco in one hour and twenty minutes, at Moulsey, July 23, 1817. It was a game
battle on both sides. His next battle was with Church, in September of the same year, at
the same place, which he also won in half an hour. His subsequent affairs were a draw
with Johnson (the broom-dasher), at Canterbury, November 11, 1817; beat J. Dunn, fifty-four
minutes, twelve rounds, Kildare, July 4, 1820; beat Simmonds, seven rounds, Macclesfield,
August 21, 1820; fought a draw with Dick Davis, £200 a-side, Manchester, July 18,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
